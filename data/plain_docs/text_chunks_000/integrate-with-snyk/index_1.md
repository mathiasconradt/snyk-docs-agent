The Integrations page shows all active integrations, including any data automatically synced from your existing Snyk Organizations, and provides access to the Integration Hub.
The following supported Snyk data are automatically synced: Snyk Open Source, Snyk Code, Snyk IaC, Snyk Container. 

Navigate to the Third-party integrations for Snyk AppRisk to check all available integrations and their setup details. 

Each connected integration enables you to pause data syncing, modify integration profiles and configurations, delete the integration, or check when the integration was last synced and when the next sync is scheduled.
