The "Snyk Vulnerability Intelligence for SBOM" ServiceNow Integration allows you to know when your software is at risk, how to fix it, and track the workflow to completion. In the event of a massive zero-day vulnerability, such as Log4j, you want to quickly see if the vulnerability is present in your environment and which applications are impacted. 
Additionally, to better manage risk and compliance requirements, you need a complete list of the open-source and third-party software components used in application development, as well as the ability to identify and triage remediation for any vulnerabilities discovered in SBOM components. Snyk Vulnerability Intelligence for SBOM allows you to identify that risk.
