The Snyk ServiceNow AVR can help teams that want to accomplish the following:
Track and manage vulnerabilities efficiently: Create and update ServiceNow Application Vulnerable Items (AVITs) automatically from Snyk Open Source SCA and Snyk Code findings.
Make faster, data-driven security decisions: Automatically prioritize vulnerabilities found across the SDLC, build automated workflows to route tasks to the correct teams, and facilitate better collaboration across the organization. Tickets created against vulnerabilities found across the SDLC are routed faster to the appropriate team.
Get a unified view of vulnerabilities and remediation status: View application vulnerabilities using dashboards to see current status, remediation reports, and executive summaries–all in one place. Your team will get a single view of Snyk SCA and SAST findings, such as vulnerabilities in open source dependencies, first-party code, the number of Projects imported, and vulnerabilities fixed, for improved tracking and increased efficiency,
Understand risk and impact of vulnerabilities: Calculate vulnerability risk and determine prioritization using ServiceNow’s vulnerability and risk calculators combined with Snyk’s industry-leading intelligence.
