From the ServiceNow Store, search Integrations for "Snyk". From there, select "Snyk Vulnerability Intelligence for SBOM". Once that integration is selected, follow the steps in the "Installation Guide" shown on that page.
As your customers upload SBOMs to ServiceNow, whether for purchased applications or internally developed applications, background jobs use the Package URL data found in SBOMs to query the Snyk Vulnerability Intelligence Database and add vulnerabilities to the "Third-Party Library" in ServiceNow. 
The "Snyk SBOM Dashboard", included with the installation, provides key metrics from your environment in graphical format.
