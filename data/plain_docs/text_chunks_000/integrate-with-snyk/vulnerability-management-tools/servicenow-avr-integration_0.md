  Prioritize Business Application risks and enhance your organization’s
  application security posture.

Snyk integrates into ServiceNow® Application Vulnerability Response (AVR) to track and remediate software vulnerabilities in open-source and first-party code.
Snyk for ServiceNow AppVR gives enterprise application security teams a single view of all their organization’s open-source and first-party code vulnerabilities, from development to production. A single view showing vulnerabilities tracked by application, severity, and scope results in better coordination with development teams to protect against potential software breaches.
Bringing these insights directly into ServiceNow Application Vulnerability Response gives your team visibility into the security issues of your applications. This enables better prioritization of incidents, speeds up ticket assignments, and fixes issues to reduce risk across the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
When Snyk identifies that an issue is fixed, the Application Vulnerable Item (AVIT)  in ServiceNow is closed.  If Manage Exceptions in ServiceNow or Manage False Positives in ServiceNow are configured in the integration, exceptions and false positives go through the customer-designed approval process. When approved, an ignore is added to the Snyk UI automatically.
