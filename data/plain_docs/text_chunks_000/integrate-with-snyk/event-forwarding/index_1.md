Snyk supports sending two different types of events:

Snyk issue events - these events are sent when new issues are discovered in a Snyk Project, or when an issue is updated. Each event contains information about the vulnerability or other problem found, including whether a remediation is available. 
Snyk platform audit events - these events are sent every time a Snyk user performs an action within the Snyk platform. For more information, see Audit logs. 


The Snyk issue event type does not include Snyk Cloud issues.


The Snyk platform audit event type is available with Snyk Enterprise plans. See Pricing plans for details.
