Transition to Snyk Apps
Snyk is transitioning event forwarding integrations to use the Snyk Apps platform. This change will enable new features and enhanced security across current and future Cloud Events integrations. 
During the transition, existing integrations will continue to function normally, and customers will have the opportunity to authorize the integrations to ensure they continue working once they become Snyk Apps. You can complete authorization for existing integrations by following these steps:

Go to the Settings page for your Organization
Go to the settings section for the integration you want to authorize, for example, Amazon EventBridge, AWS CloudTrail Lake, AWS Security Hub.
Click the Authorize app button and complete the App authorization flow

At the end of the transition window, integrations that have not been authorized will no longer be able to forward events and will cease functioning.

Snyk event forwarding integrations allow you to push Snyk platform events directly to certain products on other platforms, enabling you to set up custom alerting, build your own reporting, trigger automation, and more.
