Configuring and managing this integration for a Group is supported only by the Snyk API. You can remove an integration using the endpoint Delete a group registration. For tips on how to use the API, see the section about configuring a group-level integration.

To delete a Group-level integration, retrieve the integration ID. This is the same ID that is returned by the API when you create a Group-level integration. You can also get all currently configured Group integrations with the endpoint List all group registrations.
