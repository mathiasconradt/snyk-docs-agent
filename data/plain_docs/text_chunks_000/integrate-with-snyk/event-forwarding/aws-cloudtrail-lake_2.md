To get started setting up a CloudTrail Lake integration, whether for a group or a single Organization, follow the setup instructions in the AWS CloudTrail Lake documentation, choosing Snyk as the integration type.
Choose Snyk, Add integration for Snyk
During the setup, you must supply an External ID for the integration. The value for this ID depends on whether you are setting up the integration for a single Snyk Organization, or for a Snyk Group that includes all child Organizations.
