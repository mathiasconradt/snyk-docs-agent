In the SCC console, navigate to Marketplace and search for Snyk. Alternatively, navigate directly to the Snyk for SCC marketplace listing.
Click SIGN UP WITH PARTNER to install the Snyk for SCC integration. During this process, you will create a Findings Source for Snyk and a Service Account with Security Center Findings Editor permissions.
Navigate to Google Cloud IAM and locate the Service Account you created in the previous step, then create a service account key in JSON format.
Make a note of the Source ID (Findings Source name) and the Service Account Key, as you will need to provide them to the Snyk Web UI.

You can then set up the integration in Snyk using the Snyk Web UI or REST API.
