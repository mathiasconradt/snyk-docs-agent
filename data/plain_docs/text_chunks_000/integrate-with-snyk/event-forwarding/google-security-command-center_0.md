Release status
The Google Cloud Security Command Center integration is in Early Access, and is available to all customers on a Snyk Enterprise plan. 

The Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) integration sends Snyk issues to SCC, enabling you to view and manage Snyk issues alongside cloud security findings from Google Cloud in a single pane of glass. Snyk issues are represented in SCC as code security findings. When Snyk issues are updated, corresponding SCC findings are automatically updated as well.
Use the following instructions to set up the Google Security Command Center integration:

Access the Google Cloud SCC Console using the Snyk for SCC marketplace listing to create a Finding Source
Set up the integration using either the Snyk Web UI (recommended) or the REST API.
