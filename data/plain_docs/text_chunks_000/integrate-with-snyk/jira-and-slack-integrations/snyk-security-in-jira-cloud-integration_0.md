Snyk Security in Jira Cloud helps developers identify, prioritize, and triage security vulnerabilities related to their code repositories directly from the Jira interface.
The Snyk Security in Jira Cloud integration mirrors your Snyk scan results from the Snyk platform to Jira. You can view Snyk results in your native Jira environment and create Jira issues for your results as needed. You can see which Snyk Organizations are connected and which Snyk Targets are associated with your Jira projects.
