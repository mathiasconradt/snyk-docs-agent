To set up the integration, you must generate a Slack webhook. You can do this either via the Incoming WebHooks app or by creating your own Slack app.
Once you have generated your Slack Webhook URL, go to your Manage Organization settings and enter the URL.
Enter URL of the Slack webhook

Only webhooks created with Slack Apps are supported; webhooks created with Slack Workflows are not supported.
