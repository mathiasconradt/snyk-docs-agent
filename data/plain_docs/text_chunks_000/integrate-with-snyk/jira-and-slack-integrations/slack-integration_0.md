Snyk recommends that all customers use the Slack App, as the Slack integration is outdated.

You can set up Slack to receive Snyk’s alerts about new vulnerabilities that affect your Projects and new upgrades or patches that have become available.

Vulnerabilities detected on initial import of projects are not sent to Slack immediately.
