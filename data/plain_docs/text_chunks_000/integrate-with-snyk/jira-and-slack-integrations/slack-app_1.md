The Snyk app for Slack highlights newly disclosed vulnerability information across your software from imported Projects and presents actionable context within your Slack workspace channels. Your teams get the issue notifications that matter the most and can act on them without leaving Slack.
This has the advantage of:

Enhancing collaboration to discuss and resolve vulnerabilities quickly
Maintaining awareness of relevant and emerging vulnerabilities
Minimizing disruptions with issue notification thresholds

The Snyk app for Slack is based on Snyk Apps, providing you with the benefit of more granular scopes and more ability to configure issue notifications at the Organization and Project levels.

Vulnerabilities detected on initial import of Projects are not sent to Slack. Only newly disclosed vulnerabilities from imported Projects are sent to Slack.
