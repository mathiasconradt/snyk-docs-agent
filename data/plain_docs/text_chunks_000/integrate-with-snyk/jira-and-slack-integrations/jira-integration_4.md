After you set up the Jira integration connection, open one of your Snyk Projects in the Snyk Web UI. A new button, Create an issue, appears at the bottom of each vulnerability and license issue card. This button allows you to create a Jira issue.
Create an issue button
When you select Create an issue, a Jira issue creation form appears. This form includes the Snyk issue details, which are copied into the associated fields. You can review and edit this form before creating the issue.
Select the Jira project to which you want to send the issue. The fields in the example that follows are based on the fields that the specific Project has, so switching between Projects may show different options.
Crate a Jira issue
After you create a Jira issue, the Jira key with a link is displayed on the issue card. If you are using the Jira API, you can generate multiple Jira issues for the same issue in Snyk.
