Snyk recommends that all customers use the Snyk Slack app, as the Slack integration is outdated.

The Snyk app for Slack is built as an official Slack App.
The Slack app provides the following benefits and more:

Improved support for Snyk products: Open Source, Code, Container, and IaC
Support for filtering on severity levels
Support for overriding notifications at the Project level
