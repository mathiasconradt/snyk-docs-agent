If you are using any of the supported IDEs to write Python, there are some configurations you must add to scan Python manifest files properly.
If you are using a virtual environment, you must add the PYTHON_PATH to the Additional Options text input in the Snyk integration settings, for example, --command=.venv/bin/python. Snyk tries to look for a *req*.txt file in the root of the Project as it is seen in the IDE.
However, if you have manifest files in other directories within the root of the Project, Snyk cannot identify them. For Snyk to find them, you must use the --all-projects option. Snyk then recursively searches each Project directory to find all the manifest files.
If those directories each require a different virtual environment to run, the Snyk scan will not be successful because it will use one virtual environment to search for installed dependencies. In this case, it is best to use the CLI or the Git integration rather than an IDE to get vulnerability information on all the dependencies listed in each Project directory.
