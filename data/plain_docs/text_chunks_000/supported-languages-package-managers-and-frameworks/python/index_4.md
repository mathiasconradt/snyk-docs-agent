Some Python Projects may contain dependencies that require specific versions of Python. Therefore, the version of Python used when scanning can affect the dependency tree that Snyk generates.
You can specify the version of Python that Snyk uses to scan dependencies in both the CLI and Git integration.
See Snyk CLI for Python for information about the Python version and installation and use information for Pip, Poetry, Pipevn, and setup.py.
See Git repositories and Python for information about the Python version and installation and use for Python and pip and use of Poetry and pipenv.
