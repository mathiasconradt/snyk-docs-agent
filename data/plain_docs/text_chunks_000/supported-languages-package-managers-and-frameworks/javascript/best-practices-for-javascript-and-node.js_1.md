With SCM integrations


On the Snyk Enterprise plan only, Snyk can monitor container images and their open source or Linux-based packages being used in production using Kubernetes integration to notify customers of known vulnerabilities for applications in production.\


On All Snyk plans, where a production integration does not exist, use the snyk monitor CLI command to take a snapshot and monitor what is being pushed to production.\
