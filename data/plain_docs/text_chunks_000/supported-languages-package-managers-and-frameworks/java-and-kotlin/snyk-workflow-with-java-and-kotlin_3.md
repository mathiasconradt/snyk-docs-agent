(Snyk Enterprise plan only) Snyk can monitor container images and their open source or Linux based packages being used in production using Kubernetes integration, to notify customers of known vulnerabilities for applications in production.
(All plans) Where a production integration does not exist, use the snyk monitor CLI command to take a snapshot and monitor what is being pushed to production.
