Sometimes customers develop advanced dependency management strategies and may not necessarily use the standard and frequently used package managers. For that reason, Snyk has provided test APIs.
For on-time testing using the Snyk API, you can use the Test endpoints. Examples include Test for issues in a (Maven) public package by group id, artifact id and version and List issues for a package.
