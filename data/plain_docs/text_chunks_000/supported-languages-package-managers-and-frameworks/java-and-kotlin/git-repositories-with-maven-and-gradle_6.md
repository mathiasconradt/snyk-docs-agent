If your application build uses private package repositories, you must configure the relevant Snyk integration to get the most accurate results.


To use package repository integrations with the Improved Gradle scanning Early Access feature, use the configuration instructions and settings for Maven.
These will be detected and used in improved Gradle scans.

In the Java language settings, you can integrate Snyk with your private package repositories (for example, Artifactory or Nexus).
This enables Snyk to build a complete dependency tree when scanning Maven or Gradle (Early Access) projects that reference private packages.
For more information, see Artifactory Registry for Maven in the Package repository integrations.
