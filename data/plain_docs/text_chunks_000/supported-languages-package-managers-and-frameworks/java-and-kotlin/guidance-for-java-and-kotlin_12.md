Snyk automatically looks for application (such as open source, maven, and npm) vulnerabilities as part of a container scan. We recommend you integrate via CLI or Registry earlier in the pipeline and use this as an additional signal/insight into what is in production.
See Snyk CLI for container security for more details.
