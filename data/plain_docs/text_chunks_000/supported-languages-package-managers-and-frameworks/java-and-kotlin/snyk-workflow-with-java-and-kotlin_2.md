Snyk can passively monitor and provide a QA gate by failing build checks during testing for policy violations.
Snyk provides flexible capabilities, including:

Gradle Plugins (Community project)
Maven Plugins
Dedicated plugins for Jenkins, Circle CI, and others (see relevant marketplaces)
Using Github Actions
The Snyk CLI can be used in most CI/CD systems (see examples)
Fail the build based on criteria using options or the snyk-filter tool
There are containerized versions available
With Partner Platforms: Azure, Bitbucket, and AWS have built-in pipes/components for use with Snyk.
Note for Java: using the Git integration with Bitbucket Cloud or using the CLI instead of the prepackaged Bitbucket Pipe is suggested.
