By default, archives are not scanned. However, the CLI can recursively extract archives to analyze the source code inside.
To enable archive extraction, specify the depth of the extraction using the --max-depth option.
The supported archive formats are:

zip-like archives
tar archives
tar with gzip compression algorithm
