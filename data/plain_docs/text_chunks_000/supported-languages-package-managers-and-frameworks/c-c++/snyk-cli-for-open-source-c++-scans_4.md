When you scan C++ Projects, the following data is collected and may be stored for troubleshooting purposes:
Hashes of the scanned files: All files are converted to a list of irreversible hashes.
Relative paths to scanned files: The paths to files relative to the directory being scanned are included for better identification and matching.\
\
Example:\
./project-name/vendor/bzip2-1.0.6/blocksort.c
