Feature availability\
The License Compliance feature is available on the Snyk Team or Enterprise plan.

This feature allows a company to create a license policy for Open Source applications, indicating what licenses are not approved for use. When Snyk detects a match for a license that is not approved, Snyk sends an alert. This alert contains the name of the license and license policy text. 
License policy text is associated with the license issue by your administrators.  This text provides custom direction on what to do or why the license issue is contrary to the policy.
The following shows a license policy text example at the bottom of the screen, giving you directions on what to do if the license is found.
