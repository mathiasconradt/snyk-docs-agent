To support a specific framework, Snyk Code must both support the relevant language and be trained on Projects using the framework. The found patterns are then annotated by the security team and extended by curated content.
Most frameworks are partially supported out of the box, as Snyk Code needs only to parse the code to analyze it. In some cases, frameworks may require specific rules, or require specific program analysis engine updates, or both.
If you notice any gaps in support for a specific framework, contact Snyk Support.
