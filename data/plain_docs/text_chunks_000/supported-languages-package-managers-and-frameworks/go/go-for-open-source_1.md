Supported Go versions
Snyk supports all versions of Go, including the latest stable version listed on the Go All releases page.

Refer to the Go details for supported package manager and features.

Only official releases are tracked. Commits, including into the default branch, are not identified unless included in an official release or tag. 
In the case of projects that have a package manager, this means a release to the package manager. 
In the case of Go and Unmanaged scans (C/C++) this requires an official release or tag on the GitHub repo.
