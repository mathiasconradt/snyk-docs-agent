Snyk supports only NuGet with SCM integrations.
Import .NET Projects from any of the SCM integrations Snyk supports.
When your Projects have been imported, Snyk analyzes your Projects based on their supported manifest files and then builds the dependency tree and displays it in the Snyk Web UI.
You can use the Snyk Web UI to:

Scan your entire Project, including the build dependencies, or skip them.
Update your language preferences

Follow the next steps to enable the Scan build dependencies for .NET, using the Snyk Web UI:

Log in to your account and navigate to the relevant Group and Organization you want to manage.
Navigate to Settings and select settings for .NET.
To scan all development dependencies, ensure that Scan build dependencies are checked.

After you select a NuGet project for import, Snyk builds the dependency tree based on these manifest files:

For .NET Core, the *.proj files
For .NET Framework, the *.proj file, and packages.config

Examples of supported Project files include:

*.csproj
*.vbproj
*.fsproj

A .NET project can use different frameworks. Snyk creates a separate list of dependencies for each framework, showing each one as its own Snyk Project. This setup helps you understand why you need certain dependencies and makes it easier to plan how to fix any issues.
