Snyk improved the .NET scanning process to ensure that dependency results are consistent across the CLI and SCM integrations. This update also eliminates false positives from runtime dependencies that were previously displayed in the UI. The approach involves using the internal workings of the .NET ecosystem.
The improved .NET scanning also provides the capability of scanning any Project that can be successfully built by the dotnet SDK itself, removing the previous limitations of not being able to scan Projects using certain .NET features, such as .props files, global.json, or Central Package Management.
