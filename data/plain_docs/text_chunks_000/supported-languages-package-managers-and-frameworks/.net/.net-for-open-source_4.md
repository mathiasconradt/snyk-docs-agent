The project.assets.json file is required for scanning. Project files can be combined with NuGet locking dependencies for a more deterministic project.assets.json resolution.
Examples of supported Project files that resolve into project.assets.json include:

*.csproj
*.vbproj
*.fsproj

If needed, restore dependencies in the .NET project by running dotnet restore and ensuring that obj/project.assets.json was created using the previous command. Then run snyk test.

Although you can run snyk test without restoring dependencies first, this may lead to less accurate vulnerability results.
