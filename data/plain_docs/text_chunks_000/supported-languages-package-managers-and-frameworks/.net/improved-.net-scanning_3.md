The .NET scanning improvements are available when importing Projects using Git repository integrations.
Follow these steps to enable the improvements:

Activate improved .NET scanning for your Organization or Group through the Snyk Preview menu.
Re-import any repositories with .NET applications; re-testing existing Projects is not sufficient.
