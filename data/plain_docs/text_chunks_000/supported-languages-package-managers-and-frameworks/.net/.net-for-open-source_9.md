See the Fix your vulnerabilities page for a general understanding of how Snyk helps you fix Open Source vulnerabilities within your Projects.
If you are managing your Project dependencies with NuGet and using PackageReference or packages.config, Snyk can automatically update the dependency version in your manifest file, provided there is an actual fix for it. You can then review and merge your fixes.
