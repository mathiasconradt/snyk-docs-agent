With the introduction of Tenants, Snyk has added new possible role assertions at a Tenant level, enabling customers to assign Tenant-level roles.

The following role mappings assign users a tenant role.
Only one Tenant-Level assertion may be provided for each user. If no Tenant-level assertion is provided, the user will be granted the Tenant Admin role if they do not already have a Tenant-level membership.
snyk-tenantadmin
