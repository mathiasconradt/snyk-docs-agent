Use PR Checks to introduce gating
Snyk Pull Request(PR)/Merge Request (MR) Checks allow you to prevent new security issues from entering your codebase, by automatically scanning code changes when you submit a pull request (PR). PR Checks are available for open-source vulnerabilities, license compliance issues, and your own code issues.
If you import Projects through a source control integration, then Snyk Open Source PR Checks is a good place to start introducing gating. 

Snyk recommendes announcing the changes prior to rolling out the changes. See Announcement Templates for examples of how to message your developers.
