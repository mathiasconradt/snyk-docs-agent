It is important to ensure the teams know the exception processes and how to address if a PR is blocked or a build fails. 
For example:

Let the team know who has the authority to override a PR check if a pass is mandatory.
If a build fails, can the issue be ignored and the test rerun? Who can run it? Or can a script be run allowing that step to pass? Who can make that determination?
