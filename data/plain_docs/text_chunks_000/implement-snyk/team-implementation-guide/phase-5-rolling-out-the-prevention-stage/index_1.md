Below are the two common areas that allow you to "prevent new issues": 

Snyk tests on pull request (PR)/merge checks (MR),  currently available for Open Source. 
Snyk Code PR checks are currently in Beta.
Adding "Snyk test" to your CI/CD pipelines (you may have already implemented "Snyk monitor" to import your Projects as part of the pipeline). 
Additionally, open source, code, infrastructure as code, and container vulnerabilities can all be gated.

In either case, Snyk suggests that you communicate these changes clearly to your developers before implementing any form of gating.
