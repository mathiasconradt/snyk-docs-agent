If you focus on visibility first, you can get a clear sense of the security issues, but without always fixing them.

This does not stop you from fixing issues using Snyk. You can start fixing issues early, but the emphasis is to avoid blocking development early on, build trust, and slowly introduce gating in later phases, usually the prevention phase. This is true of the smallest or largest teams - communication is key.

Visibility achieves a broad view of security across your application portfolio, avoids Snyk scans being seen as a blocker, and minimizes impact on development processes. 
This visibility helps build trust while rolling out Snyk. With the Team plan, this equates to onboarding your projects through Git repository and disabling PR Checks/Auto PRs in the integration settings. Choose an important project and enable PR checks after communicating with the relevant team members. This guide details this later on.
