DevSecOps-led implementation, focusing on securing your custom images and environment:

Scan and secure any custom base images that your development teams pull from.
Integrate with your Container Registry, and scan the images you provide to your development teams.
Scan the image you have chosen and built after adding common internal tools and standardizing image parameters.
Ensure developers also scan their containers after adding their custom tools/packages to ensure that the container remains secure before deployment. This scan will also detect application vulnerabilities.
After you have secured your Containers, start actively scanning your IaC files and cloud environments for misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.
Introduce Snyk to development teams to scan their Open Source and Code to reduce application vulnerabilities.
