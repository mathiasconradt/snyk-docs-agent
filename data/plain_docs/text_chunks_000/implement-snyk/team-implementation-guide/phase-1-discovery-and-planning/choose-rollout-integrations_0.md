SDLC integration points
Snyk offers many integrations that seamlessly integrate into every stage of SDLC. 
Many businesses typically roll out automated solutions first, then slowly introduce tools to enable the developers. In addition, gating features are gradually turned on over a period of time to minimize disruption.

As using multiple integrations can result in duplicate reporting of issues, you do not initially need to implement more than one integration type. For example, you can start by importing everything with Git repositories, then later use the CI/CD view for fine-grained detail (potentially removing the source control integration if both views are not desired).
