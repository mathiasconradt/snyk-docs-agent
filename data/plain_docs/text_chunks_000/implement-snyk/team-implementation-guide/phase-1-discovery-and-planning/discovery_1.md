To successfully implement Snyk, you must identify the skills needed and the stakeholders who will be involved. For example, you must identify people who can:

Perform the initial setup/admin tasks.
The developers who may want to trial the workflows/functionality.
Generate tokens with the necessary permissions for git repositories, and other integrations being considered like Jira, or container registries.
Modify pipeline scripts.
Who would want input on open-source licensing if this was a priority for purchasing, otherwise the default policy is often sufficient.
Any stakeholders that need to be reported to.
