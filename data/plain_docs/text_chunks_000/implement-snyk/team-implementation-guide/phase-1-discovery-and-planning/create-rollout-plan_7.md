Ensure there is an exception process in place and users are aware. For example:

If a pull request/merge request is failed by Snyk, let the users know who is the Snyk admin who can override it. 
Similarly, if Snyk fails in CI/CD, let users know who can create an ignore rule, authorize it to progress, or configure CI/CD to run without the Snyk test or set it to monitor only.
