In smaller organizations where a few individuals may have the necessary access, involving the stakeholders can be quick and easy. For a small team, early startup, it can be as simple as finding who can create credentials for Snyk to access the system or update a CI/CD script. In a larger enterprise, where you may have a single team using Snyk, this tends to be more organizationally complex, and the following RACI matrix can assist in determining:

Responsible: the person ultimately accountable for carrying out the task or deliverable.
Accountable: the approver who must sign off on work before it is considered complete.
Consulted: those whose opinions are sought, two-way communication.
Informed: kept up-to-date on progress, one-way communication.

For large enterprises, the following RACI matrix is useful to clearly define roles and responsibilities during rollout:

This ensures all stakeholders are engaged in suitable capacities without duplicated or neglected efforts. Following the matrix enables smooth collaboration, with individuals contributing specialized skills within their designated areas. 
The clear delineation of duties promotes productivity, efficiency, and accountability. Overall, the RACI framework is an effective method for orchestrating a structured, well-coordinated onboarding process resulting in the successful implementation of Snyk.
