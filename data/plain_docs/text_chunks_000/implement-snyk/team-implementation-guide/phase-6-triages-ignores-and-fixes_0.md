Tips for deciding on prioritization
After you implement a strategy to prevent new issues from entering your repositories, whether blocking builds or running in a non-blocking/advisory mode, the next step is to prioritize and start fixing issues in your backlog.

In Phase 4: Create a Fix strategy, you created a plan for prioritizing your Projects and issues. To implement this, you can schedule regular meetings with development team leads, to assist them with this process. 
If you use Jira Cloud, you can download and install the Snyk Security in Jira Cloud plugin from the Atlassian marketplace. This allows you to view information on your Snyk Vulnerabilities directly in Jira, and use Jira Automation to create new tickets when new vulnerabilities are identified.
