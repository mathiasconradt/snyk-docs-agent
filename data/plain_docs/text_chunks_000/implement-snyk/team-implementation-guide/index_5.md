Finally, you can focus on fixing your backlog of security issues. This can take several forms:

As part of the initial rollout, security or initial stakeholder may triage the initial results for the existing portfolio, create tickets for priority items to investigate or address, or have the teams do that for their applications as part of the weekly triage process.
After getting visibility and achieving prevention, you can look at your backlog of issues.  For example, a weekly triage process with the key stakeholders can guide the teams on what to address.
