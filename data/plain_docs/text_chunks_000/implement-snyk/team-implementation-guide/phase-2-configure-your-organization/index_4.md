Snyk comes with a default policy. You can find this under Settings-Licenses if your team wants to add custom text when an issue is found or change severities for specific licenses.
Administrators can set license policies to define Snyk behavior for treating license issues. For example, you can allow or disallow packages with certain license types to avoid using packages containing incompatible licenses.
By default, Snyk determines the severity of licenses as follows:

High severity - licenses that present issues for commercial software.
Medium severity - licenses that have clauses that may be of concern and should be reviewed.

Configure policies to match your requirements.
