In each case, you can use the "ignore" feature to stop these from appearing each time you run a test. 

Confirm ignore with an Organization Admin (they may need to complete this step themselves). 

When adding the ignore:

Ensure you add a detailed reason, so the ignore reason is clear to others who see this issue.
Set an expiration date for the ignore rather than having a permanent ignore. This is essential, as whilst the issue may not be fixable/relevant today, it should be reviewed regularly (monthly or quarterly) to see if it is possible to implement a fix.


In Settings-General it's common to limit access to who can ignore an issue and require a reason.

By default, the Organization Collaborator role has permission to ignore issues, but this can be controlled per Organization in the Settings page (that is, restricted to Organization admins only). 
See Ignore issues for more details.
