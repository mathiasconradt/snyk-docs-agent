You can implement Snyk for your team in days. You can start scanning with Snyk soon after implementation, often using the Git integration. For details, see Getting started and Start scanning. The main guidance for a team to roll out Snyk is to onboard your projects, pilot Snyk functionality with an important project, confirm it works best for your workflows, and then enable the other projects, letting the team know through regular communication what the expectations are.
