Automated provisioning
Provisioning is the first interaction you have with Snyk before getting access to the Snyk platform and features on your plan. For a detailed walkthrough, see the Auto-provisioning guide.
Provisioning can be completed with a new or existing user account and must be completed before you continue the rest of the implementation process.
Automated provisioning is enabled only on multi-tenant environments for the following regions:

🇺🇸 United States: SNYK-US-01, SNYK-US-02
🇪🇺 Europe: SNYK-EU-01
🇦🇺 Australia: SNYK-AU-01


For more information on region authentication methods, see Which authentication methods are available for each region?.
