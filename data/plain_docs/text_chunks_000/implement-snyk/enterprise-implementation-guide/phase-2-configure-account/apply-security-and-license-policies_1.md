Group administrators can define security policies, thus providing an automated way to identify certain issues or types of issues, and apply actions like changing the severity or ignoring the issue based on your conditions. 

Configure policies to increase priority or decrease it as needed. 
Create ignores where needed

See Security policies for more details.
