Use tags to categorize the assets. You can use tags in multiple ways:

Automatic tags: Snyk Essentials automatically tags repository assets with information about the used technologies (Python, Terraform, and so on) in the repository and repository latest updates. You can also use policies to tag repository and package assets. GitHub and GitLab topics can also be pulled from the repository and applied as Asset Tags in Snyk Essentials or Snyk AppRisk.


BitBucket cannot automatically detect the language used in the source code from the repositories. In Snyk Essentials or Snyk Essentials, you can only see the language tags that have been manually added for BitBucket. For more information, see the official documentation provided by BitBucket.


User-defined tags: set up custom tags through policies to categorize your assets beyond the system-generated tags. See the Create policies page for more details.
