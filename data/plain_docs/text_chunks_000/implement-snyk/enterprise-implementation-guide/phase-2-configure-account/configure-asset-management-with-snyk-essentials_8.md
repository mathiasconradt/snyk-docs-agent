The Inventory feature is structured in four sections, each focused on a specific area:

All Assets: All the discovered assets, grouped by their type.
Asset Hierarchy: Asset Hierarchy layout shows assets in a hierarchical structure. The list of assets is sorted by issue counts, and, where applicable, the package assets are listed underneath the repositories where they are located. Assets hierarchy is visible only when there are no filters applied. Navigate to the Assets inventory components page for a detailed overview of all options available in the Assets Hierarchy view and to the Filters capabilities page for more details about the filtering options and how to use them.
Teams: SCM repository assets grouped by teams. Note that only SCM organizations with teams, and repositories assigned to a team, appear on this layout.
Technology: SCM repository assets grouped by technology, as detected and tagged by Snyk Essentials.

If you are using Snyk Essentials for the first time, Snyk recommends you first use the Coverage filter to determine where you have Snyk implemented. Then, you can use the Coverage Gap filter to identify the assets that do not meet the coverage requirements set in a Set coverage control policy.
You can use the Coverage Gap filter to:


 Find any asset that does not comply with the Set coverage control policy requirements: 
Coverage gap - Use case 1
*   Find any assets that do not meet the coverage requirements for Snyk Open Source or Snyk Code, or both of them simultaneously: 
Coverage gap - Use case 2
