Start building your asset inventory by setting up the necessary integrations.

The scanned information is automatically imported within two hours after enabling all features.  Note that for large onboardings, it is suggested to wait up to 24hours for all information to be processed.

Access and configure the integrations from the Integrations view. Select the Integration Hub option to see the list of all available integrations. See the Using the Integration Hub section for more details.
The default display in the Integrations view includes the configured Snyk integrations. The status of each integration, Connected or Not connected, depends on the specific content imported into Snyk.
You can customize an existing integration or connect a new SCM integration.
