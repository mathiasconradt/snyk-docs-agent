Configure your SCM integrations in the Integrations Hub.

Integration Hub is a distinct integration interface dedicated to asset management. It is available with Snyk Essentials and is separate from the Organization integrations interface, which is used for security and license scanning.

When you set a token on the Group Level Integrations screen, it enhances security by providing a comprehensive view of access. This token allows broad access to all repositories, even those not permitted for individual developers, ensuring alignment between security and development teams.
The supported SCM integrations are:

GitHub
GitLab
Azure DevOps (Azure Repos)
BitBucket

Navigate to the Snyk SCM Integrations page for more details about the supported SCM integrations.
