Configure your SDLC Integration Points (IDE, Git repo, CI/CD, Container Registry)

For information about importing Projects, see Import Projects and Rollout.

When you create your Organizations, you must decide where to add Snyk in your Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). 
Snyk recommends that you first gain visibility for your vulnerabilities, with features related to gating disabled initially.
The first step is to import your Projects using one of the available methods, and then after you have full visibility for any existing issues and vulnerabilities, you can start to gradually introduce gating methods to prevent new issues from being added to your codebase.

Notification settings (email notifications)

Snyk suggests that you initially disable all email notifications so that users do not receive a large number of notifications while Projects are being imported.
You would disable this at the Group level for new Organizations and at the Organization level for all existing Organizations.
