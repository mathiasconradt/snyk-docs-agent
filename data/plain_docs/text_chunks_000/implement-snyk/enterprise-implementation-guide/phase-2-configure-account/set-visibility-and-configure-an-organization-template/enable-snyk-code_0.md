When you create a new Organization, Snyk Code (SAST) scanning is disabled by default. Snyk recommends enabling Snyk Code before you import your first Projects to Snyk. If Snyk Code is enabled after a Project is imported, Snyk will not detect Snyk Code files.

Select the Settings > Snyk Code option.
Click the toggle to enable Snyk Code, and then click Save changes.

You can use the API endpoint Enable/Disable the Snyk Code settings for an org to perform this operation at scale for a large number of organizations.
