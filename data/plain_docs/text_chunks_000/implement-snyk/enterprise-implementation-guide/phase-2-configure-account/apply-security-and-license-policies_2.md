Group administrators can set license policies to define Snyk behavior for treating license issues. For example, you can allow or disallow packages with certain license types, to avoid using packages containing incompatible licenses.
By default, Snyk determines the severity of licenses in the following way:

High severity - licenses that definitely present issues for commercial software.
Medium severity - licenses that have clauses that may be of concern and should be reviewed.

Configure policies to match your requirements.
See Snyk License Compliance Management for more details.
