Confirm an ignore with a Group Admin or Organization Admin. They may need to complete this step themselves. 

When adding an ignore:

Ensure you add a detailed reason, so the ignore reason is clear to others who see this issue.
Set an expiration date for the ignore, rather than having a permanent ignore. This is essential, as even if the issue may not be fixable or relevant today, it should be reviewed regularly, monthly or quarterly, to see if it is possible to implement a fix.


It is common to use the General Settings to limit access for users to permission to ignore an issue and to require a reason.

By default, the Organization Collaborator role has permission to ignore issues, but this can be controlled for each Organization on the settings page, that is, restricted to Organization admins only. 
See Ignore issues for more details.
