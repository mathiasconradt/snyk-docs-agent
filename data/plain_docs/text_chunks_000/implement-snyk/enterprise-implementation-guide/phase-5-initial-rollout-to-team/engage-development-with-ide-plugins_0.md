Introduce Snyk IDE plugins to your developers
Encouraging your developers to install a Snyk IDE plugin is a key step in improving developer adoption and achieving “shift left,” where developers are more empowered and responsible for fixing issues before they are committed to pull requests or added to builds.
Snyk IDE plugins help developers to find and fix security vulnerabilities and issues. This allows individual developers to pass security reviews, avoid costly fixes later in development, and reduce time to develop and deliver secure code.
The webinar Workflows for Developers using Snyk in the IDE and CLI covers IDE usage in more detail, including a demo using an IDE plugin to review an issue.
