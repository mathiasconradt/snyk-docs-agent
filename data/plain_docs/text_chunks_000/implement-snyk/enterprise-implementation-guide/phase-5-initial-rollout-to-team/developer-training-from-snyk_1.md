Snyk Learn Security Education teaches developers how to stay secure with interactive lessons exploring vulnerabilities across various languages and ecosystems. The modules can be filtered by ecosystem and contain information and guidance on fixing common vulnerability types, such as NoSQL injection attack and Server-side request forgery.
These lessons are designed to improve your developers’ security knowledge in a broad context, rather than being focused specifically on Snyk products or the remediation advice provided by Snyk. This means they can serve as a great introduction to developer security for less experienced teams in this area.

Snyk recommends introducing developers to this resource early on in the rollout process.
