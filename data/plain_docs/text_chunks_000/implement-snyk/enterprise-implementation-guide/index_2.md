For large businesses, Snyk recommends that you first focus on visibility - getting a clear sense of the security issues, but without always fixing them.

This does not stop you from fixing issues using Snyk. You can start fixing issues early, but the emphasis is to avoid blocking development early on, build trust, and slowly introduce gating in later phases, usually the prevention phase.

Visibility achieves a broad view of security across your application portfolio, prevents Snyk scans from being seen as a blocker, and minimizes impact on development processes. 
This visibility helps build trust while rolling out Snyk.
