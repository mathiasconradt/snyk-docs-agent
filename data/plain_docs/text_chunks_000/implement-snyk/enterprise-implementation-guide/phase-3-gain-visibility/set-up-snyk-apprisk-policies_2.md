You can create a policy by navigating to the Policy view and using the New policy button in the top right corner. Name the policy and, optionally, describe it. 
The policy builder editor focuses on two main areas:

Define the filters - Set filter conditions on asset properties.
Set actions - Define actions to be taken on filtered assets.
