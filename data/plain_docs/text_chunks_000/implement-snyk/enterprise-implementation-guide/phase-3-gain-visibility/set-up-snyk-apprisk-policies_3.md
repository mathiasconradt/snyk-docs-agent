When creating a new policy, you can choose from several available filters. Here is a selection of the most used ones:

Name: Many companies have a naming convention for their repositories and other assets. Use the naming convention to check if asset names contain or match a certain string.
Asset Type: you can apply policies only to certain asset types, such as repositories or software packages.
Class: you can reduce a lot of noise on actions by only targeting a specific Class. For example, only take action on Class A assets, as these are business-critical assets.
Tags: You can use either out-of-the-box system tags or custom tags that Snyk has defined.

Here are the steps for creating a policy:

Navigate to the Policy view and click the New policy button in the top right corner.
Provide a name and, optionally, a description of your policy, and click Next.
Define the filters of your policy and click Apply.

Set actions for your policy. Click the + icon to add an action. You can trigger an action based on the assets you have filtered or create a logic node to combine it with another filter node. 
Create policy - Multiple nodes
5. When you add another filter node and select the + icon next to it, you can flow into existing logic nodes.
6.  Trigger an action based on the assets you have filtered. 
Create policy - Set action
