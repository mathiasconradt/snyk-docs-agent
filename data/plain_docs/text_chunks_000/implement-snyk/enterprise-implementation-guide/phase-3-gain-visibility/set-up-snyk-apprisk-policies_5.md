Classification policy - classify assets based on importance.
Tagging policy - sets a tag on the matched assets.
Notification policy - get notifications about changes that take place on your assets.
Coverage and coverage gap policies - use the Coverage filter to verify if an asset has ever been tested by the product and the Coverage gap filter to verify if the asset meets the coverage requirements set in a Set coverage control policy.
