You need two components to create and understand a policy:

 Filters: helps you create asset groups based on defined criteria such as tags or asset name.
Actions: set actions that can be performed on the filtered assets, such as setting asset classification or sending a Slack message or email.


A newly created policy may take up to 3 hours to become visible and be applied.
