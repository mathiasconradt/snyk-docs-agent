After importing your Projects, you can add metadata using Project attributes or Project tags. This makes it easier to filter and report on specific subsets of your Organization.
For example, if you add both Project attributes including frontend and a tag of Team:Unicorn to all of your Projects that a specific Dev Team owns, you can easily generate a report of frontend critical vulnerabilities in production that team Unicorn owns. 
Attributes and tags are also useful features that can be used to configure Project collections and Project views, making it easier for you to view Projects in a grouping that makes sense to you.
