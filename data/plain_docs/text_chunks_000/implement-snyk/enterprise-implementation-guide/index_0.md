Each business and environment is different. With that in mind, this guide aims to help an enterprise business to implement Snyk. The guide provides recommendations on implementing a large-scale rollout, focusing on the stages needed to help get to an ideal rollout.
The guide starts by recognizing that most businesses:

Have a backlog of issues in their existing software.
Are continuously creating new software and need to secure new code. 


There are typical timelines for implementation depending on the size and scope of your business.
If your business is small and nimble, Snyk implementation can be achieved in days. You can start scanning with Snyk soon after purchasing, often using a Git integration and the API Import Tool. See the Getting started and Start scanning sections for details of this type of process.
However, for larger, more process-oriented enterprises, the implementation process may take weeks or months and it requires more detailed planning to succeed. 

The Snyk Essentials plan is included in the Snyk Enterprise plan, meaning that you will gain access to the following features:

Coverage control for SCM.
Policy creation to automatically trigger specific actions.
Backstage file customization for SCM integrations.
Customized analytics and reports about the application. 


If you want to upgrade your plan to Snyk AppRisk, please contact your salesperson. \
