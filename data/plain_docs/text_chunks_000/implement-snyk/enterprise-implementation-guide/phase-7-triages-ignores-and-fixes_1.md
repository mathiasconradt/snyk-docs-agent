When should you ignore an issue?
When deciding your priority for fixing issues, you may see specific packages or vulnerabilities that you do not currently want to fix. This could be for a range of reasons, such as:

The fix introduces breaking changes, and you do not have time to fix them.
This vulnerability does not apply to you for an environmental or contextual reason.

In each case, you can use the ignore feature to stop these issues from appearing each time you run a test.
