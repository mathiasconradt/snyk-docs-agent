There are a number of different reports in Snyk to help you get an overview of your issues and vulnerabilities. For more information, see Reporting.

On the Issues Summary report, the Risk Breakdown section displays open, new, and resolved issues across different Organizations. Tracking the amount of activity in each Organization can help you identify which teams are adopting the tool most actively.
Individual Organization administrators can also view reports focused on their Organization as a way to help identify which vulnerabilities are most common across their repositories, and also to track issues resolved in different Projects.
