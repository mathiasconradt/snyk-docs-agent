Project Import StrategyConsiderationsAdvantagesDisadvantagesCLI (automated with CI/CD)Has to be configured for each application within CI/CDCan select what to test and when: which package managers, where in the process, which language to analyzeMay need development effort for integrationRequires configuration per application.CLI (run locally by user)Can be used to perform testing locally while the developer is working on an application, very configurable per scan type.Local use caseNot meant for visibility or automation. Can require buildable code or dependencies to be installed, for example, Gradle without lockfile, ScalaAPITypically for advanced use cases.Integration into CI/CD workflows or custom tooling. Automated integration into CI/CD pipelinesRequires API familiarity, access through the  Enterprise plan.Git code repository integrationUsed for onboarding and daily monitoring: rapid vulnerability assessment across application portfolioContinuous monitoring of repositories, even when you are not working on itCentralized visibility for teamsMonitors specified branchCode does not need to be builtCan be initiated theough the UI, however larger portfolios should use API to initiate onboarding of repositories with the Api Import ToolSome languages/package managers have better resolution through use of  the CLI: Gradle without lockfile, ScalaPull request (PR)/merge request (MR)  scanningImmediate feedback on introduced issues on the PR/MR against any branch on repositoryConfigurable rules for pass/fail
