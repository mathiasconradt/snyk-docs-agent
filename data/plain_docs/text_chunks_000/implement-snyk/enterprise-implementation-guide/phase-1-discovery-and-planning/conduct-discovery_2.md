In smaller organizations where a few individuals may have the necessary access, involving the stakeholders can be quick and easy. You can use a RACI matrix to determine who is:

Responsible: the person ultimately accountable for carrying out the task or deliverable
Accountable: the approver who must sign off on work before it is considered complete
Consulted: those whose opinions are sought, two-way communication
Informed: kept up-to-date on progress, one-way communication

For large enterprises, the following RACI matrix is useful to clearly define roles and responsibilities during rollout:

This ensures all stakeholders are engaged in suitable capacities without duplicated or neglected efforts. Following the matrix enables smooth collaboration, with individuals contributing specialized skills within their designated areas. 
The clear delineation of duties promotes productivity, efficiency, and accountability. Overall, the RACI framework is an effective method for orchestrating a structured, well-coordinated onboarding process, resulting in the successful implementation of Snyk.
