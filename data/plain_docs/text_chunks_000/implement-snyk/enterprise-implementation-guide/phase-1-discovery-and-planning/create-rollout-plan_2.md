Start by selecting a small group of engaged pilot users from:

Application security teams
Project teams building new applications
Developers of business-critical applications

This allows you to:

Thoroughly onboard initial users
Gather feedback to refine processes
Identify issues before the broader rollout
Build success stories to promote Snyk

Typically, within a large enterprise, importing everything using a repository integration for visibility and working through the rollout with a small pilot team allows you to identify the best processes and ways to implement Snyk within your environment.
