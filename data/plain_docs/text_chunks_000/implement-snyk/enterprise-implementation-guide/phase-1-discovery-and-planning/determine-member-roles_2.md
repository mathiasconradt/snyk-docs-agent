The User role management feature provides Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Snyk, allowing you to create and enforce customized access by assigning a set of permissions to a role that will be granted to users. The permissions within these roles can be updated and changed even after assigning them to users.
As with all pre-defined roles, the permissions within the Organization Collaborator role cannot be changed, so you cannot grant the developers the ability to Mark SCM Check as Successful. This pre-defined role can be helpful when introducing developers to Snyk PR Checks but cannot be expanded when a developer is fully functioning in a Snyk environment. This is where Custom Roles are useful.
The most common types of custom roles include Team Lead and Developer, but your company can have custom roles that suit your business structure. Snyk has provided multiple templates for you to use in structuring your Enterprise in Snyk; for more custom role suggestions and the listed permissions, see Custom role templates.
