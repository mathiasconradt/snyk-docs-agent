SDLC integration points
Snyk offers many integrations to work seamlessly with Snyk in every stage of the SDLC. 
Many businesses roll out automated solutions first, and then slowly introduce tools to enable the developers. In addition, gating features are gradually turned on over a period of time, to minimize disruption.

As using multiple integrations can result in duplicate reporting of issues, you do not initially need to implement more than one integration type. For example, you can start by importing everything with Git repositories, then later use the CI/CD view for fine-grained detail. You can remove the source control integration if both views are not desired.
