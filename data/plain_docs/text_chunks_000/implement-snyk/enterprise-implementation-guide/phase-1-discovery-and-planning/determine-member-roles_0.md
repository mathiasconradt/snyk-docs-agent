Use default or custom roles?
A key consideration when setting up Snyk is determining if the pre-defined user roles align with your needs or if you need to customize roles for your business requirements.

The pre-defined user roles in Snyk have a fixed set of permissions that cannot be changed. One of the biggest advantages of customizing roles is that you can adjust the role permissions to align with your desired level of control.
