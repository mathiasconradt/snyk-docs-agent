Integrating Snyk into CI/CD pipelines, such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI, automates security checks during the build and deployment process. This ensures that vulnerabilities are detected early in the software development lifecycle and prevents their propagation into production. Typical features include:

(Optional) Ability to passively monitor results during build and view results in Snyk
(Optional) Ability to test and potentially break the build if results are found based on criteria you specified

The advantages of CI/CD integrations are:

Assess local code vulnerabilities
Full control over testing: which tests to run and where in the build script
Automation by CI/CD if desired

See Snyk CI/CD integrations for more details.
