Snyk Essentials is part of the Snyk Enterprise offering, and it provides discovery and visibility for your application assets and security tool coverage. 
When or before you use Snyk Essentials, you should consider the following items:

Who would want coverage visibility or is accountable if an important application is not being monitored by security tools?
Who would you notify, using automated policies, if a repository were missing coverage by a security tool?
Are you using Application context, and are there fields that might be valuable in automating policies with Snyk Essentials?
Is it possible to categorize important applications in Git or CMDB (ServiceNow) using topics or fields, such as a PCI topic or tag?
Would this also reduce noise about test applications and internal applications by implementing an internal tag, topic, or naming convention? 
Read the available examples of common policies that can be created using Snyk Essentials.
