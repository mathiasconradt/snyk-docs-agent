The two functions that allow you to ‘prevent new issues are:

Snyk tests on Pull Request (PR) or Merge Request (MR) Checks,  available for Open Source, with Snyk Code PR checks in Beta.
Adding snyk test to your CI/CD pipelines; you may have already implemented snyk monitor to import your Projects as part of the pipeline. In addition, open source, code, infrastructure as code, and container vulnerabilities can all be gated.

Regardless of which function you use, Snyk suggests that you communicate these changes clearly to your developers before implementing any form of gating.
