Block the differences
If you are not already blocking vulnerabilities, start by blocking the differences.
This eases developers into the process, as they take responsibility only for vulnerabilities directly related to their changes. 

Run PR Checks, which include the option to block new issues. 
Snyk Delta can assist with differences in results at the CLI level.
