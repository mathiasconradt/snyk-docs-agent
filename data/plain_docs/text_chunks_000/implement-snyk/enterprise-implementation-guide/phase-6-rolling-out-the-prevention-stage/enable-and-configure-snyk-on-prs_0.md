Use PR Checks to introduce gating
Snyk Pull Request(PR) or Merge Request (MR) Checks allow you to prevent new security issues from entering your codebase by automatically scanning code changes when you submit a pull request (PR). PR Checks are available for open-source vulnerabilities, license compliance issues, and your own code issues.
If you import Projects through a source control integration, then Snyk Open Source PR Checks is a good place to start introducing gating. 

It is recommended that you announce the changes prior to rolling them out. See Announcement Templates for examples of how to message your developers.
