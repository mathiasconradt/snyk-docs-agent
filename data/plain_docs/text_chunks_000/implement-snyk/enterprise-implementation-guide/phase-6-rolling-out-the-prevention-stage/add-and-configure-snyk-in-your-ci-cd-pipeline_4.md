When you use the Snyk CLI in your pipeline, you can use a range of supporting CLI Tools that provide additional functionality, including:

snyk-delta, which can be used to compare two sets of results and identify new vulnerabilities, similar to how the PR Checks feature tests for new vulnerabilities only
snyk-filter, which can be used for more complex fail criteria, such as fail if more than three High severity vulnerabilities are found.
