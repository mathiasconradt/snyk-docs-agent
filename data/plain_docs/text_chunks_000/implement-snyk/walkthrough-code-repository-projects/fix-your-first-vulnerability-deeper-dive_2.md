When Snyk automatically creates fix PRs to upgrade a dependency, you should still research and test these PRs, as with any change. An upgrade, especially a significant one, may cause a change that breaks other parts of your code. You should not simply click Fix your vulnerabilities and submit the PR, without any research.

Tip\
Keep the packages you use up-to-date by making regular upgrades as part of your normal code maintenance practices; this minimizes the need for major changes, which are more likely to impact your code.

So, as part of a fix, you should understand the impacts of an upgrade, to ensure that it is not a breaking change. You do not want to fix a vulnerability but break the application.
