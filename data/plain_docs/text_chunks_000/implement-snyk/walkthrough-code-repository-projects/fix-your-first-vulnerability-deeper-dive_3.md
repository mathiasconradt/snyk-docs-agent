To understand the fix fully, you should research the change, examine the impacts, and make any needed secondary changes to your code, to ensure that the upgrade does not cause any problems. To do this, you should inspect the code itself.

For significant upgrades, you may decide to ignore the vulnerability temporarily (say, for 30 days), allowing you time to understand the impacts of the upgrade.
