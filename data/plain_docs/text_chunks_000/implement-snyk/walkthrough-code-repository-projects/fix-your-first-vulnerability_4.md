Snyk also provides an option to ignore a vulnerability, temporarily or permanently; for example, if you think it may not affect your code, or that is is a false positive. If you select to ignore a vulnerability, it does not appear in subsequent scans for that Snyk Project.
To ignore a vulnerability, click the Ignore button on the issue card:
