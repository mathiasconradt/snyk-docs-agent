Of course, developers do not just use Github, they have their own IDE, such as JetBrains:
View PR impacts by inspecting code in the IDE
If you have the relevant Snyk IDE extension (see Snyk for IDEs), you can review the vulnerability in that IDE, allowing you to inspect the impacts of changes in your own code environment. You can then manage the PR from your IDE, and push this change up to GitHub as normal.
