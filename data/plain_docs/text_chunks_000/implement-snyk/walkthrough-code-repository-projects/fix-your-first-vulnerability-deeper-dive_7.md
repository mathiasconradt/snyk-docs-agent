When this occurs, developers should provide an alternative solution to address the vulnerability. Possible actions include:

Accept the risk by ignoring the vulnerability for a period of time. For example, if this vulnerability is assessed as low-risk for your application at this point:

Ignore the vulnerability until a fix is available:

Ignore a vulnerability until a fix is available

Research whether the vulnerability is a false positive; if so, you can ignore it permanently:

Ignore a vulnerability if it is a false positive

Change your code: write a code solution to address the vulnerability, perhaps even providing a suggestion for the open source code to address it, contributing to the open source community.
Replace the vulnerable dependency with other code.
