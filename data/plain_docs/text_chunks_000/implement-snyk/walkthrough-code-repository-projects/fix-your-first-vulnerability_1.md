When we open a Snyk Project file, we see the list of issues Snyk has found in this Project, and we can research each issue, using Snyk and other sources of information.
Different actions may be available for each vulnerability:

Fix the vulnerability immediately, by raising a Fix PR. See "Fix this vulnerability" function.
Ignore the vulnerability, permanently or temporarily. See Ignore the vulnerability.
Assign the vulnerability to research and fix (see Assign fix work and Fix your first vulnerability - deeper dive)


Snyk fix functions available depend on the vulnerability and the type of scanning.
