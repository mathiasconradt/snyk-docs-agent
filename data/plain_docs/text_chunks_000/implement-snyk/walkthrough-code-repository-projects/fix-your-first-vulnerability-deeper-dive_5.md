How you process upgrades (whether Snyk Fix PR advice becomes the actual PR submitted) may be driven by your own team processes. Factors involved may include the level of upgrade (major/minor/patch), the team code processes, and the areas of code impacted.
For example:

A large established team with mature processes and released applications to maintain might have practices to ensure that all developers always check and test all upgrades for breaking changes.
A startup team with unreleased applications in development might accept that all developers can process minor or patch upgrades, to aid speedy development.
Your team might have processes that state junior developers must have all changes reviewed by senior mentors before making the change, but senior developers can have more autonomy for changes.
Your team may have a flexible approach, with processes to mandate different levels of oversight / review based on the size of the upgrade.


You can configure settings for your code repository integration to disable Snyk’s ability to open fix PRs, if this is seen as too risky - for example, see GitHub integration.
