This example showed you how to apply a fix to an open-source vulnerability. Depending on what items you scan, you can use other Snyk products to resolve issues:

For scan items built into a container, such as a Docker file, see Analysis and fixes for your images from the Snyk Web UI.
For Kubernetes deployment files, terraform and other IaC files, see Getting started with current IaC.
To scan your team's own code, see Fix Analysis.
