The Snyk Priority Score, ranging from 0 - 1,000, is our evaluation of the seriousness of the vulnerability. The Snyk Priority Score includes CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) information, plus other factors such as attack complexity and known exploits. For example, this Hibernate vulnerability has no known exploit allowing attackers to take advantage of that vulnerability.
Other factors also affect the score. For example, SQL injections are easy to run (you just need a web browser and submit a form), so increasing the score, but it takes more work to understand and exploit the results for that attack, so decreasing the score.
