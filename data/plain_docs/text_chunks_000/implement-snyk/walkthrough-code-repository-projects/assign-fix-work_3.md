Jira integration is available with all paid plans. See pricing plans for more details.

Some teams base all their work around Jira tasks; we’ll look at this as an example.
Let’s assume that your development team assigns fix work based on Sprints, and decides that the next development Sprint will be dedicated to vulnerability fixing.
As part of this Sprint planning, the team leader can:

Review the vulnerabilities in a project.
Decide which vulnerabilities to fix.
Create a Jira issue for each vulnerability.
Assign these Jira issues as tasks to developers to fix these vulnerabilities.
Track progress on these tasks during the Sprint.

Snyk Jira integration allows you to run this process from the Snyk Web UI.
