Navigate to the issue you have decided to fix, then click Create a Jira issue:
Create a Jira issue
You can then define the Jira task details for this fix:
Create a Jira issue details
You can assign this task to a developer in the team, following your team’s normal Sprint processes.

You may want to create a Jira issue even if Snyk knows how to fix the change, and even if it is a very minor upgrade; assigning issues allows your team to manage, justify and track code changes.
