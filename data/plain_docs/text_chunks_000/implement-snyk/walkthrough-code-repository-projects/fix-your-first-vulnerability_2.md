Reminder\
We use GitHub in this example, most other supported Git code repository integrations work in a similar way. See Git repository integrations (SCMs) for details.

For vulnerabilities in open-source libraries, Snyk provides an option to create a Pull Request (PR) to upgrade dependencies to the latest version of a package. This upgrade PR will fix the vulnerability, removing it from your code.
Access this function using the Fix this Vulnerability button on the issue card:
Click Fix this vulnerability to create a PR
Snyk then prompts you to confirm your vulnerability selection:
Open a Fix PR for a vulnerability
Your PR is selected by default, but you may wish to raise a PR to upgrade other libraries by selecting them

This list of all fixes may be overwhelming - you may only want to fix the vulnerability you’ve done the research on and know about.

Finally, click Open a fix PR at the bottom of that screen to generate a fix PR:
Generate the fix PR for your vulnerability
You can then manage this change as you would for any standard code PR in your development process.
