Look back at the results of your scan:
Project scan results
The scan shows all the vulnerabilities in all aspects of your application. Of course, it is unlikely that you are responsible for every entry in this list, but it is important to be aware of the full picture.
If your Snyk Open Source scan shows no vulnerabilities in your open-source libraries, that is great, but there may still be a lot of issues identified by other scans, such as of your container. Even if the developers in your team did not create or manage these issues, you should know about them.
