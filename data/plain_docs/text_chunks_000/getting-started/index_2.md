To create a free account or sign up for a pricing plan, navigate to snyk.io. For details, see Snyk Pricing Plans. 
If your company has an existing Snyk account and uses single sign-on (SSO), use the SSO link provided by your administrators.
If your company requires an invitation to use Snyk, when you log in for the first time, you may see a list of Organizations, which in Snyk control access to Projects. To request access to an Organization, select the name of an Organization Admin in order to request access.

If you log in with a different authentication provider from the one your company uses for the Snyk account, you create a new account. You will not be logged in to the correct Organization for your company.

When you log in to the Snyk Web UI, Snyk shows your preferred (default) Organization. Snyk also uses the settings for your preferred Organization when you test a Project locally using the CLI. To change your default Organization, see Manage account preferences and settings.
