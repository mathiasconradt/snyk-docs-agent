The Group-level Integrations view focuses on asset management and discovery and is available with Snyk Enterprise.

The Integrations page shows all active integrations, SCM or, third-party, including any data automatically synced from your existing Snyk Organizations, and provides access to the Integration Hub. You can use the Integrations Hub button to add SCM integrations, connect a third-party integration, add App Context to an SCM integration, or use the Snyk Runtime Sensor.
You can find an overview of all your integrations on the Snyk Web UI Integrations page. You can enable or disable your integrations, edit them, or remove them from your configuration.
For more details about available integrations, see Snyk Essentials SCM integrations and Integrate with Snyk.
