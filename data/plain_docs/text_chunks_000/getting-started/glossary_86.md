A technique for examining source code to identify issues related to code quality, structure, or performance, such as determining code reachability or spotting potential inefficiencies. While this technique may touch on security concerns, its primary focus is often broader, covering various aspects of code health. In contrast, Static Application Security Testing (SAST) specifically targets the identification of security vulnerabilities within the code, such as coding flaws that could lead to security risks.
