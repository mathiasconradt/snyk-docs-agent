Snyk tracks and flags Pull Requests (PRs) in the top-most vulnerable Projects, including:

PRs that can be raised to fix vulnerabilities in some of the most vulnerable Projects.
PRs that have already been raised by or through Snyk and are open and awaiting review.

For Projects with the Fix vulnerabilities link, use this link to view Project details with an option to open a fix PR. For details, see Snyk Fix Pull or Merge Requests.

Snyk tracks and flags PRs in GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and Bitbucket Cloud only, and only for the top-most vulnerable Projects. If you use another SCM, the Pending tasks section shows PRs that can be raised but not PRs that have already been raised.
