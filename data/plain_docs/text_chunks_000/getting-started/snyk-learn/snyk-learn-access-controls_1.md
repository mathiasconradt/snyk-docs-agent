To grant permissions for access to Assignments beyond the default Organization and Group Admin roles, you must create a custom role with a set of permissions for assignments. The custom role must have the View Users permission in order for managing assignments to work. The following lists the permissions for managing assignments:

View Organization assignments 
Edit Organization assignments
Create Organization assigners
Delete Organization assignments

After the role is created, a Group or Organization administrator can give this role to users of Snyk. 
For more information, see Snyk Learn Assignments.
