All reports are available as interactive table views and downloadable CSV reports.
User progress is associated with individual users, meaning that if they are members of multiple Organizations, their lesson progress will be the same across all Organizations.
The report CSV contains the historical completions and current progress. The learning path overview report CSV contains the current learning path progress and the last completion date.
Progress reporting is also available through the Snyk Learn API (beta), offering two endpoints:

Org catalog progress - progress mapped to the Snyk Learn catalog
Org user progress - progress mapped to the Snyk user
