Finding learning opportunities
You can see all of the lessons and learning paths available at https://learn.snyk.io/catalog/. You can search or use the filters to help find learning opportunities that are relevant to your interests and needs. The catalog covers common application security topics and product training for Snyk. For developers, we recommend getting started with the OWASP Top 10 Learning Path.

Issue details in the Snyk Web UI, in IDE integrations, and in pull requests, may include a link to Snyk Learn education when there is a lesson related to the issue.

When you are logged in to Snyk Learn, you can also filter by status to see learning that is in progress or already complete.
You can specify categories of learning on your profile to improve learning recommendations.
