After you have imported a Project, and Snyk has scanned that Project for issues, you can view the results of your scan and take action to fix issues.  You can see the number of issues found, grouped by severity level (Critical, High, Medium or Low). For details, see Severity levels.
The scan results and available actions depend on the type of Project you scan:

Open-source libraries: see Snyk Open Source.
Application code: see Snyk Code.
Container images: see Snyk Container.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Kubernetes, Helm and Terraform configuration files and cloud misconfigurations: see Snyk IaC.
