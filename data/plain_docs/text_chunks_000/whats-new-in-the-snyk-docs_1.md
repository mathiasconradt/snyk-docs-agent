Snyk AppRisk

A new third-party integration, the Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) integration, is now available in Early Access. This integration sends Snyk issues to SCC, enabling you to view and manage Snyk issues alongside cloud security findings from Google Cloud in a single pane of glass.
Snyk Runtime Sensor has been updated and now clearly separates the DaemonSet and Deployment helm installation steps.
