Snyk Code

 Snyk stores repository-specific information, for example, the name of the Git repository and file names. Snyk accesses your repository code for a one-time analysis and caches the source code according to the Cloud provider's storage minimum policy. After this period, only the location (file path, line, and column) of the issues found, the issue id, and explanations are maintained. Your code is removed and is not stored in the Snyk network or logs.
Results are stored in a database and used for analytic and monitoring purposes by Snyk.
Snyk Code does not use any customer code (1) for engine training purposes or (2) to extract examples to show possible fixes.
The AI model for Snyk Code Fix Suggestions is trained on public repositories with permissive licenses, where any data from repositories with changing licenses are immediately removed. Static analysis, automated assessment, and partial human labeling are used during the data collection.
The scan results do not contain original source code but rather pointers to positions, for example, files, line, and column numbers, plus identification meta-information so that results are displayed using the correct source code version.
Snyk stores repository-specific information, for example, the name of the Git repository and file names.
The server infrastructure ensures separation between customers by using authentication and authorization. Snyk Code uses software controls to ensure customer data segregation. All communication is encrypted using high-grade industry-standard protocols.
