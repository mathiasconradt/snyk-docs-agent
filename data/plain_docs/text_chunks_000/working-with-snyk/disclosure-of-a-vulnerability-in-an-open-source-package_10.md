As part of the public disclosure phase, Snyk:

Assigns a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID for public tracking
Adds the vulnerability to its public vulnerability database, providing information about the vulnerability and the related fix

Public disclosure may be initiated either by completing the fix assistance phase or through a process failure in prior phases.
During the public disclosure phase, Snyk, and preferably the maintainer, disseminate information about the vulnerability and the fix to the public. Snyk may disseminate information through public email lists, web pages, or any other medium it deems appropriate to reach the intended audiences.
