The Silver Success Plan includes Silver Support.
Pooled Technical Support: Support tickets are handled and triaged by a pool of Technical Support Engineers.
24x7 support hours: Snyk Technical Support Engineers actively respond to tickets 24 hours a day, Monday to Friday. For urgent customer issues outside of 24x5, Snyk provides a 24-hour support telephone number (+1-844-835-8167). This is served by a telephone answering service, which routes the request to Snyk on-call engineers.
