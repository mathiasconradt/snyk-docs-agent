The following assumptions are reflected in the services outlined in this Declining Balance of Hours description:

All services using a declining balance will be performed remotely using video conferencing software such as Zoom unless written approval is obtained for onsite work and travel arrangements.
Services using a declining balance will be scheduled and delivered consecutively unless otherwise agreed by the parties or to accommodate holidays. All scheduling is subject to Snyk’s resource availability at the time of scheduling.
Services using a declining balance will be scheduled and delivered during Snyk’s normal business hours 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. local time zone, Monday through Friday.
Customer acknowledges that all Snyk Professional Services depend on collaboration with Customer’s resources and, therefore, will provide prompt access to its knowledgeable resources, relevant information, and systems, as mutually agreed upon in order to complete the work.
Additional hours may be purchased on a subsequent Order Form if the Customer wishes to continue to engage with Snyk consultants after the end of the contract period.
