The Platinum Success Plan includes Platinum Support.
The Platinum add-on provides extended, in-depth, and skilled expertise to help you maximize your investment with Snyk. by aligning a Technical Support Engineer to your account who will have the relevant level of depth in your environment, deployment, and use cases that will help to expedite resolution time and offer best practices.
Technical Support Engineer: The aligned Technical Support Engineer (TSE) to be assigned to the Customer's account has familiarity with the Customer's environment and deployment, helps with solving support tickets, and is the Customer's point of escalation. The aligned TSE will also partner with the Customer for incident management.
24x7 support hours: Snyk support engineers actively respond to tickets 24 hours a day, Monday to Friday. For urgent Customer issues outside of 24x5, Snyk provides a 24-hour support telephone number (+1-844-835-8167). This is served by a telephone answering service, which routes the request to Snyk on-call engineers.
Prioritized support ticket routing: Tickets raised by Platinum Success Customers are automatically routed to Snyk Technical Support Engineers and prioritized ahead of non-Platinum ticket traffic.
