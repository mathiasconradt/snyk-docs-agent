The Snyk Consultant will run a 60-minute training session for Customer’s Developers to ensure all collaborator users know how to access Snyk results and initiate tests. This training will cover a range of tools, including the UI (app.snyk.io), IDE plugin, and CLI. Developer Training will be completed after the product-specific modules of Jumpstart have been completed.
