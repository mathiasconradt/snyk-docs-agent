A pre-engagement call will be held before the start of the Jumpstart Services listed herein, to ensure the Customer understands the prerequisites required for engagement start along with the deliverables completed during the engagement timeframe. Customer prerequisites, including resources, availability, and deliverables for each product module, will be reviewed and confirmed. The Customer acknowledges that complying with these prerequisites is its sole responsibility, and Snyk will not be responsible for any delays or failure to deliver the Jumpstart Services based on the Customer’s failure to meet these prerequisites.
