The following assumptions are reflected in the services outlined in this Residency Services Description:

All Residency Services will be performed remotely using video conferencing software such as Zoom.
The Customer’s Snyk subject matter expert must be available to work remotely with the Snyk expert.
At the time of scheduling, Snyk and the Customer will mutually agree on the start date of the Residency Service. All scheduling is subject to Snyk’s resource availability at the time of scheduling.
Residency Services will be scheduled and delivered during Snyk’s normal business hours 8 am to 5 pm, local time zone, Monday through Friday.
A Residency “day” is defined as up to a maximum of 8 hours of remote Residency Services. 
The Customer acknowledges that the Residency Services depend on collaboration with the Customer’s resources, and, therefore, will provide prompt access to its knowledgeable resources, relevant information, and systems, as mutually agreed upon to complete the work.
The Residency Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner, with knowledgeable Snyk consultants.  Except for the foregoing, the Residency Services are offered “AS IS” without warranty of any kind.
Residency Services are confined to work that can be reasonably completed within the engagement’s allocated hours. Such work may be incomplete and/or require further effort from the Customer to complete post-engagement.   Additional hours may be purchased on a subsequent Order Form if the Customer wishes to continue to engage with Snyk consultants after the term of the Residency Services.
All services and communications will be conducted in English language.
