Delivery approach - Probely configuration
Web Target configuration, including authenticated scans
The Snyk Consultant will work with the Customer to configure Web Targets (up to three web applications) to be scanned by Probely. This includes configuring the authentication for each Target where necessary, such as using a login form or recorded login sequence. Snyk will also help to set up a single navigation sequence for each web application.
