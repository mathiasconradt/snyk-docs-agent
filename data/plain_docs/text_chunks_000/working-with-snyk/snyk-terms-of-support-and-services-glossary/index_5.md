Technical Success Manager: Named Technical Resource assigned to the customer account to guide their onboarding and support their Snyk implementation as it grows and evolves.
Dedicated TSM hours: Dedicated TSM hours refer to the amount of time the Named Technical Resources will spend working on the account, regardless of whether that time is with the customer. For instance, if the Customer has a list of questions that a TSM needs to research, the time spent researching is taken into account considering the dedicated hours.
The dedicated hours are a guideline meant to set expectations, as opposed to a contractual term. If the Customer needs more time one week, and less the next, the TSM will be flexible and adherent.
The Platinum Success Offering includes on average up to eight (8) dedicated TSM hours per week.
Solutions Architecture: Snyk will provide in-depth technical consulting as needed, up to 40 hours per quarter, for customer use cases requiring deep integration of Snyk functionality and data into existing enterprise systems and workflows above and beyond the core product workflows, typically through the use of Snyk APIs, CLI automation, and other means in a reliable and scalable way for enterprise customer environments.
Guided Onboarding: Snyk will guide the Customer through onboarding ensuring the customer is enabled with the following:

Effective account configuration (including Org structure, SSO setup, and so on)
Project import strategy
Remediation triage strategy

Customer onboarding needs vary depending on the solutions purchased. 
Success Planning: The Technical Success Manager will conduct discovery to uncover the Customer’s short and long-term goals and will create a strategic plan to reach those goals. The TSM will also help define the KPIs based on the Customer’s goals and will create a plan for the customer to track them. As the Customer reaches their goal and matures, the Technical Success Manager will continue to strategize to ensure the Customer’s continued success and growth.
Business Review Cadence: The Technical Success Manager will deliver a business review with the Customer and Snyk account team members quarterly.
Live Training Sessions: Snyk will deliver live training sessions relevant to the Customer's implementation of Snyk and their tech stack and use cases. The Platinum Success Offering includes up to two (2) live training sessions per month (24 per year).
Private Slack channel: Customers have direct engagement over Slack with their Technical Account team to encourage collaboration
