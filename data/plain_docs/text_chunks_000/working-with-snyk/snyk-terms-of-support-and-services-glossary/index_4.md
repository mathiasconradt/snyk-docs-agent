Technical Success Manager: Named Technical Resource assigned to your account to guide your onboarding and support your Snyk implementation as it grows and evolves.
Dedicated TSM hours: Dedicated TSM hours refer to the amount of time the Named Technical Resources will spend working on the account, regardless of whether that time is with the Customer. For instance, if the Customer has questions that a TSM needs to research, the time spent researching is taken into account considering the dedicated hours.
The dedicated hours are a guideline meant to set expectations, as opposed to a contractual term. Hours do not roll over. If the Customer needs more time one week, and less the next, the TSM will be flexible and adherent.
The Gold Success Offering includes on average up to four (4) dedicated TSM hours per week. 
Guided onboarding: Snyk will guide the Customer through onboarding ensuring the Customer is enabled with the following:

Effective account configuration (including Org structure, SSO setup, and so on)
Project import strategy
Remediation triage strategy

Customer onboarding needs vary depending on the solutions purchased. 
Success planning: The Technical Success Manager will conduct discovery to uncover the Customer’s short and long-term goals and create a plan to reach them. The Technical Success Manager will also help define the KPIs based on the Customer’s goals and will create a plan for the Customer to track KPIs. 
Business review cadence: The Technical Success Manager will deliver a quarterly business review with the Customer and Snyk account team members.
Live training sessions: Snyk will perform live training sessions on a subject of the Customer’s choice to educate on practices that promote the Customer’s success. The Gold Success Offering includes one (1) live training session per month (12 per year).
Private Slack channel: Direct engagement over Slack with your Technical Account team to encourage collaboration.
