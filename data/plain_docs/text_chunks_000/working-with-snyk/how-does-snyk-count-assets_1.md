Snyk may monitor customer billable asset volumes on a daily basis and actively review customer utilization on a rolling thirty (30) day period. If a customer’s billable asset usage exceeds the limit granted by the plan purchased by twenty percent (20%) on a rolling ninety (90) day period or by one-hundred percent (100%) for a period of thirty (30) days, Snyk may notify the customer to discuss the overage and, [if action is required], provide an expansion invoice to increase the billable asset allocation. Except in unusual circumstances, Snyk will not invoice retroactively for Managed Billable Asset overages.\
