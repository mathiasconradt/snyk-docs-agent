Snyk puts the following safeguards in place to ensure data is secure

Snyk will perform a clone only when an SCM integration flow requires it, for example, PR check, import, and test.
Communication between the cloning service and cache is encrypted with TLS.
Cloned assets are deleted from the file system immediately after populating the cache.
All data is handled by Snyk in accordance with the SOC 2 standard. For more details, see Snyk certifications.
Your data is analyzed only for the purposes of improving code security and code quality and in accordance with your Data Processing Addendum.
