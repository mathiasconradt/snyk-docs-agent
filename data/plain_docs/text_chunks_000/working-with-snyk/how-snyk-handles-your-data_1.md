Snyk leverages the latest software development practices and technologies to provide customers with the flexibility to use the Snyk developer security platform in the manner that best suits the needs of their business.
Snyk cloud-first deployment options offer ease of use and scalability while also providing the required level of data protection, with multi- and single-tenant options supported in the US, EU, and AU regions.
Snyk deployment options are as follows:

Multi-Tenant SaaS: The simplest, most common, and most cost-effective way to use Snyk’s developer security platform
Single-Tenant SaaS: Private Cloud - An isolated and fully managed instance of the Snyk developer security platform. For details, see Snyk Deployment Options.
Snyk Broker: A client service installed on your private infrastructure, acting as a proxy between the Snyk developer security platform (multi- or single-tenant) and your on-premise codebase. Snyk Broker securely handles inbound and outbound connections, encrypting data during transit and deliberately controlling the access Snyk has to your data. Sensitive credentials stay behind your firewall.
