Through the program described on this page, Snyk encourages the community to report potential vulnerabilities in open-source packages, facilitating quick identification, validation, and remediation to enhance security. 
Snyk values the security community and believes that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open-source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users. Snyk aims to provide a disclosure program for the security community by which you can report security issues found within managed open-source code.
The Snyk responsible disclosure program aims to protect both the maintainer and the reporting researcher, allowing maintainers and developers who use open-source code to safely benefit from the discovery of these vulnerabilities prior to public disclosure, and crediting those researchers for their dedication.
