Upon successful validation of a submitted vulnerability, Snyk contacts the maintainer of the package to provide vulnerability details needed to begin any internal resolution process.
Snyk follows a 90-day responsible disclosure and fix timeline, allowing the maintainer of the affected package to ensure a fix is available prior to the vulnerability's being made public. An extension can be provided at the maintainer’s request, and depending on the severity of the disclosed vulnerability, Snyk is happy to wait for public disclosure until a patch is made available.
