After validating a submitted vulnerability report, an analyst contacts the submitter, using the contact details attached to the report, to acknowledge receipt of the report and to discuss vulnerability details as well as the severity the analyst has assigned.
If the submitted vulnerability was already publicly disclosed and is missing from the Snyk vulnerability database, then, once validated by Snyk, this vulnerability will be added and published in the database.
