Test usage policy
Snyk may monitor customer test volumes on a daily basis and actively review customer usage on a rolling thirty (30) day period. If a customer’s test usage exceeds the limit granted by the plan purchased by twenty percent (20%) on a rolling ninety (90) day period or by one-hundred percent (100%) for a period of thirty (30) days, Snyk may notify the customer to discuss the overage and, if action is required, provide an expansion invoice to increase the test allocation on the subscription or ask the customer to reduce its use. Except in unusual circumstances, Snyk does not invoice retroactively for test overages.
