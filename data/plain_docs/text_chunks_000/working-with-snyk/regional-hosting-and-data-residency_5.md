The SNYK-US-01 region is available to customers who joined before September 2024 and to Free plan users.

For Free or Team plan users in the SNYK-US-01 region, no configuration is required for URLs. For hosting in other regions, you must configure your environment for that region.
SNYK-US-02, EU, and AU data center Snyk accounts are available only with the purchase of an Enterprise plan.
Snyk offers almost all the same features, support, and performance in the regional multi- and single-tenant regions as in SNYK-US-01. For an up-to-date overview of feature parity across regions, contact your account team.
All Snyk Essentials and Snyk AppRisk features are supported in all multi-tenant environments, while for the single-tenant environment you need to check the availability with your account team.
Automated provisioning is only possible for multi-tenant environments and Pilot or Enterprise plan users.
