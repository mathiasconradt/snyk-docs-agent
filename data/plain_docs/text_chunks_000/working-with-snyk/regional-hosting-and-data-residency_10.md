Both the CLI and CI running CLI must be configured to run against your instance.
To do this, for CLI v1.1293.0 and later versions, use the snyk config environment command, for example:
snyk config environment SNYK-US-02
The Supported environment URL mappings are listed in the snyk config environment help.
