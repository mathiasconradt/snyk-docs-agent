Issue alert emails are notifications Snyk sends the same day as it finds a new vulnerability, license issue, or remediation.
To set the defaults for issue alert emails:

Check the Vulnerabilities box when users of new Organizations in this Group should receive alert emails by default for new issues or remediations for all Projects in a new Organization.
Check the License Violations box when users of new Organizations in this Group should receive alert emails for new license issues or remediations for all Projects in a new Organization.
If either the Vulnerabilities or License Violations boxes are checked, indicate the severity of issues for which Snyk should send alert emails by selecting All severities or Critical and high severity from the drop-down list.
To change the default for individual organizations, change the Vulnerabilities, License Violations, and Severity settings next to the Organization name. These settings apply for any individual user who has not updated personal notifications when you create new Organizations in this Group.
