An automatically created collection has the same filtering and reporting options as a manually created collection:

You can filter an automatically created collection to see only the result of your preferred scanning method, thus hiding duplicates.
You can create reports from an automatically created collection and track issues from just one of the scanning methods and ignore the rest.

Automatically created collections have no management options available:

You cannot rename an automated collection; its name will reflect the repository URL of the matched Projects.
You cannot add new Projects to an automated collection. Its content updates itself when new Projects with the same repo URL are imported.
You cannot delete an automatically created collection. You can turn off the Automated Collections feature, which will remove all automatically created collections.
