Bitbucket Server Projects cannot be grouped into automatically created collections because of their dynamic repository URL schema.

Automated Collections can be turned on under the Organization settings by users with the appropriate permissions: Organization Admins, Group Admins, or users with permissions to edit Organization settings.
Managing Automated Collections under Organization Settings
After Automated Collections are enabled, all the Organization's Projects will be analyzed, and Projects with the same repository URL will be grouped automatically into a collection. All subsequent Project imports will also update the list of automatically created collections; there is no need to refresh the list manually.
