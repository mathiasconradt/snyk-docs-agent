When Group by none (ungrouped) is applied to the Projects listing page, you can filter the list by tags using the option in the menu.
There is a filter by tag autocomplete. This is intentionally limited to a small number of results. If your tag is not displayed, enter more characters for the tag until it rises to the top of the results.
