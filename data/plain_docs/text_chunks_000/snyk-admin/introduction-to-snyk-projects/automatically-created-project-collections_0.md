Release status
Automated Collections are in Early Access and available only with Enterprise plans. For more information, see plans and pricing.

See also Limitations of Automated Collections. You can enable Automated Collections in your Organization settings.
Scanning a repository through an SCM integration and rescanning it using the Snyk CLI creates duplicate Targets within the Snyk Web UI with duplicate Projects and issues. These may not be exact duplicates. 
With the option to create Project collections automatically, Projects from these duplicate Targets will be detected and grouped automatically into a new collection. This helps identify duplicates and allows filtering and reporting on the issues of your preferred code-scanning method.

Automated Collections takes up to an hour to create or delete a collection.
