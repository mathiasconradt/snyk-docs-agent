Using tags in the Web UI, API, and CLI

Group and Organization admins can perform the actions explained on this page. Collaborators can perform the actions if they are in an Organization that is part of the Group.

The Project tags feature allows you to add custom metadata to Snyk Projects. You can create and delete tags, apply tags to and remove tags from Projects, and filter Projects using tags.
You can perform these actions in the Snyk Web UI, as shown on this page.
You can also perform these actions using the API endpoints Add a tag to a Project, Remove a tag from a Project, and  List all tags in a Group.
You can set values for a tag applied to a Project and clear the Project tags using the Snyk CLI option --project-tags. See the CLI commands and options summary for the commands that support this option.

If a Project tag is no longer assigned to a Project, the tag will no longer exist.
