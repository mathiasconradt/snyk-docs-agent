Snyk provides controls to manage your own notifications. Administrators can manage the notification defaults for others in the Group or Organization.

Weekly notification emails are sent only to Organization users, so Group Admins must add themselves as an Organization member for Organizations where they need to receive the emails.

You can also send notifications for an Organization to a designated Slack channel. For details, see  Slack integration.
