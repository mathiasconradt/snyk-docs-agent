Feature availability
The Tenant functionality is available with Enterprise plans. For more information, see plans and pricing. 

A Tenant is the top level of the Snyk hierarchy. It encompasses all your Groups and Organizations and all their corresponding Snyk work items. The Tenant is helpful in organizing access and reporting on the platform when you are a large Enterprise with multiple Groups.
At the Tenant level, you can manage access to features that work across your entire Snyk estate, such as Snyk Analytics and Members, which allows you to manage users.
Tenant-level roles include Tenant Admin, Tenant Viewer, and Tenant Member. For more information, see Pre-defined roles.
