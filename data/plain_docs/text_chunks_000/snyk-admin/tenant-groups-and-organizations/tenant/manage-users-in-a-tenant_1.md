Tenant Admin: can access all Tenant products and settings. Reserved for Snyk Admins only. 
Tenant Viewer: can see the list of all Tenant users, all the Groups, and all the Organizations of the Tenant.
Tenant Member: the default role of all users of the Tenant with no access to any Tenant level option.
