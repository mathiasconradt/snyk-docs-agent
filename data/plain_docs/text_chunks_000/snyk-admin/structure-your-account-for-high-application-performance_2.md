A small number of Snyk customers have more than one Group, for example, to keep different business units completely separate. However, anyone considering multiple Groups must understand the limitations of setting up their account with multiple groups.
Specifically, each Group is a standalone entity. This has the following consequences:

The functionality for Groups is not tied together.
There is no cross-Group reporting.
Users, Projects, and Organizations cannot be shared between Groups.
SSO is more difficult to manage across multiple Groups.
Service accounts cannot span multiple Groups.
Getting data for multiple Groups through the API requires multiple calls.

If you believe your business case requires multiple Groups, consult with your Snyk account team for assistance.
