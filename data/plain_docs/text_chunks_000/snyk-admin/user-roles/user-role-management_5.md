Group Admins can create a copy of an existing role using the Duplicate role functionality. The system copies only the permissions associated with the role that you are duplicating and role memberships are not copied over.
To copy a role, use the Duplicate button next to each role in the Member Roles list, or select a role from the Member Roles list page, and when the Role details page opens, click the Duplicate Role button.

A Duplicate role pop-up will appear, prompting you to enter a unique name and description. You can select the option to use the description from the role you copied from, but this can be edited later. Click the Duplicate Role button to proceed with creation. A Group Admin or a custom role with Role management permissions can edit this role to assign new permissions to it or remove any permissions already assigned.
