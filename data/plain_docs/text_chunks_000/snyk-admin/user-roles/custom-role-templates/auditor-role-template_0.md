This is a Group-level read-only role, meaning an Auditor can only view certain areas and functions in Snyk and cannot create PRs, Projects, and more.
This role can view issues, results of scans, and reports. An Auditor often verifies that there is a scan snapshot for a particular resource or Snyk Project. The Auditor may be external to the company.
