The Organization Collaborator role lacks permission to edit Project attributes, including using the CLI snyk monitor command with arguments such as --project-environment. Attempting to use these arguments without the proper permission causes the snyk monitor command to fail.
Users or service accounts requiring the ability to edit Project attributes must be an Organization Admin or have a custom role with the Edit Project Attributes permission assigned. A user who does not have this permission must remove any arguments that edit the Project attributes to use the snyk monitor command.
