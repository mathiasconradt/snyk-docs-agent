Member roles are supported as part of a customized SSO authentication flow. All new and existing customers who have customized SSO can use new roles they create in their IDP SAML assertions to provision users in their Organizations with those roles.
For more details, see Custom mapping

If you already have Custom SSO set up, or are planning to create Member roles after setting up Custom SSO, you can use Member roles with no modification to the Snyk Custom SSO configuration, provided you send the normalized role name in your payload in the agreed-upon format.
