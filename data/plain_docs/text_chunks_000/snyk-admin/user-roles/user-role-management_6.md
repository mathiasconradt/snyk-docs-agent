Group Admins can delete a custom role if it is no longer needed by opening it from the Member Roles list and clicking the Delete role button.
If the role is assigned to one or more users, including service accounts, you must select another role for those users to delete the current role. This restriction prevents the Group Admin from accidentally deleting a role and leaving members without access to Snyk.
When the current role is deleted, all its existing members, including service accounts, are reassigned to the new role selected.
Pre-defined roles cannot be deleted from your Group.
