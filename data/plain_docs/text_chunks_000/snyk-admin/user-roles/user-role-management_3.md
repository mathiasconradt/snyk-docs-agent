Role management for Groups takes place in Settings > Member roles. This is accessible to Group Admins or custom roles with Role management permissions.
Click the Create new role button and enter the New role name, Role Type, and Description. Role names should be unique, reflecting the user's purpose in Snyk and can contain alphanumeric characters plus spaces. The Role Type reflects the permission sets the user can have, Organization-level only or Group and Organization-level.
Create a custom Organization-level role
If you would like to continue, you can click the Create role button. Basic details about the role are visible in the top section of the Role details screen.
Role Details for a custom role
The bottom section lists all the permissions available at the level you specified under Role Type, at the Organization or Group level. For more information about the available permissions, see Pre-defined roles.

Snyk provides custom role templates to provide inspiration for your own roles. For more information, see Custom role templates.

Choose the required permissions and click the update button at the bottom of the permissions section. Note that Group-level roles have both Organization and Group-level permissions, and each permission set is updated separately.
You can enable or disable all permissions in a set quickly by using the Enable all or Disable all button in the relevant permissions section. Be sure to update the permissions using the button at the bottom of the section.
Organization-level permissions section
Permissions are grouped under categories. This is done so you can understand what functions assigning a permission might enable, and because some permissions require similar permissions to function fully. For example, for a user to move Projects (Move Project permission) in an Organization, the user must also be able to add Projects (Add Project permission) to that Organization, as these permissions work in tandem.
When the process of creating a role is completed, a confirmation message appears.
