Feature availability
The Snyk free subscription plan allows you to send up to 200 pending invitations every seven days and has only administrator roles.
Enterprise plans have administrators, viewers, collaborators, and custom roles.
For more information, see plans and pricing.

Snyk supports role-based access control (RBAC). Permissions are granted to users according to their role.
Snyk Enterprise plan customers can manage user roles, change the role of a user in the Snyk Web UI, or update member roles using the Snyk API.
When you create or edit a role, as explained on the User role management page, the Web UI displays a list of permissions you can associate with each role. For more information, see Pre-defined user roles.
There are many considerations involved in managing user roles. See these sections on the User role management page:
