Group Admins can select a custom role from the list on the Member Roles page and update the name, description, and permissions at any time. You can view how pre-defined roles are set up and duplicate those roles, but you cannot edit them.
Select the permissions from the list at the bottom and click Update Role Permissions.
When the process of updating a role completes, a confirmation message appears.
