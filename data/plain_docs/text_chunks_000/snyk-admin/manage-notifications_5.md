Weekly report emails are notifications Snyk sends to provide a summary of the vulnerability status across all Projects and Organizations to which a user belongs. For an Organization with zero vulnerabilities across its Projects, the notification lists the number of active Projects, the number of known vulnerabilities, and total dependencies.
To set the defaults for weekly report emails:

Check the Email notifications box when users of new Organizations in this Group should receive a weekly summary email.
To change the defaults for individual Organizations, clear or check the box next to the Organization name. The defaults will apply for new Organizations created in this Group.


Individual Projects cannot be excluded from Weekly reports. They can be excluded only from Issue Alert emails, and new vulnerabilities or remediations.
