Issue alert emails are notifications Snyk sends the day it finds a new vulnerability license issue, or remediation.
To customize your settings for issue alert emails for each Organization for which you are a member:

Check the Vulnerabilities box to receive alert emails for new issues or remediations for all Projects in the Organization.
Check the Licenses box for Open Source to receive alert emails for new license issues for all Projects in the Organization.
If either the Vulnerabilities or Licenses boxes are checked, indicate the severity of issues for which Snyk should send alert emails by selecting All severities or Critical and high severity from the drop-down list.

To customize your settings for individual Projects:

Expand the Organization to see a list of Projects in the Organization.
Next to each Project name, clear or check the Vulnerabilities or Licenses boxes and set the severity for the Project.
