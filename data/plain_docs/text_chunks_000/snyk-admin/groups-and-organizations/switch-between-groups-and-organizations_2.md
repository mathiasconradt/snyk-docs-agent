If your SSO email is provided by Google, then logging in with that email through the Google social provider is not the same as logging in using SSO. Using the Google social option creates a separate free account with the standard free user privileges. You can not switch between Organizations that are in different accounts.

You must also be aware of the Organization you are viewing. Organizations contain different Projects.
If you add Projects through GitHub integration, these Projects are added to the Organization you are viewing, that is, the Organization you have selected.
To navigate to a different Organization, click the Organization switcher and select an Organization:
Switch Organization
