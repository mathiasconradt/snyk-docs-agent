You can have an unlimited number of Organizations on Snyk. Your Organizations can be on different pricing plans.

When you are satisfied with the settings and integrations for an Organization, you can copy its settings and use them when you create additional Organizations.

Follow these steps to create an Organization:
1. On the Snyk Web UI, open the Organizations dropdown list from the top menu and click the Create new Organization option:
Create an Organization
2. On the page to create a new Organization, enter a name for the new Organization. Consider using a structured naming convention to identify your Organizations.

It is highly recommended to enter a unique name for the new Organization.

3. From the dropdown list, select an Organization from which to copy all settings and integrations.
4. Select Create organization.
Create an Organization
A new Organization is created and is added to your Organizations list.
By default, each Organization has a unique Snyk ID and internal name, which you can find on the Settings page of the Organization.
Review the settings and integrations for the new Organization and adjust them to meet your requirements before importing Projects to the new Organization.
