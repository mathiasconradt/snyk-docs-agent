On the Group members page, you can see all the members associated with your Group, their roles and authentication type, the number of Organizations they are members of, and the date they joined.
There are two standard roles available at the Group level, Group Member and Group Admin.

Group Admins have all Snyk permissions; see Pre-defined user roles. However, being a Group Member does not directly grant the user any rights. To have rights, users must be added as Organization members or promoted to Group Admin.
