Snyk Groups make it easier for you to work in teams. Groups can contain many Organizations, and each Organization can contain many collaborators and Projects.
As part of your onboarding, Snyk will set you up with a Group for your company. You can then add your current Organizations to this Group. If you think your company will need multiple Groups, submit a request to Snyk Support. See Structure your account for high application performance for details concerning multiple Groups.
