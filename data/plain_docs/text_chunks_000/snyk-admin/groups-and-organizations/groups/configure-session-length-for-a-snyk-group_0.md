By default, inactive logged-in users are automatically logged out after 24 hours to protect any account from being exposed inadvertently through user inactivity.
Group admins can change the default session length to any value from five minutes to 30 days.

Users who belong to multiple Groups are always logged out automatically after the shortest time configured for any of those Groups.
