Feature availability
Groups are available only for Enterprise plans. For more information, see plans and pricing.

Select the Group where you want to manage users and the Members menu option to manage your Group members.
As a Group Admin you can do the following:

View Group and Organization members
View individual members
Promote a Group member to a Group admin
Delete Group members
Filter and sort views


You cannot add external users directly to Groups; you must first add them to an Organization, and then to a Group. For more information, see Manage users in Organizations for details.
