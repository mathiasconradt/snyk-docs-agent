You can promote a Group Member to a Group Admin by selecting the role dropdown next to the user's name and choosing the Group Admin role.
Promote to Group Admin

If the user you want to promote to Group Admin is not already a part of your Group, you must first add that user as a member of at least one Organization; see Add Members on the Manage users in Organizations page. The user then appears on the Group members page with the role of Group Member. You can then promote the user to Group Admin.
