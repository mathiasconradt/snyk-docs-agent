To manage users in your Tenant, Organizations, and Groups:

You can use the Snyk API v1 to provision users to Orgs and remove members from Groups and Orgs.
To find out when a new user was added or to analyze unexpected activity, you can retrieve audit logs of user-initiated activity by Organization or Group through the Snyk REST API.
You can use Organization access requests to add users and configure session length for a Snyk Group.
