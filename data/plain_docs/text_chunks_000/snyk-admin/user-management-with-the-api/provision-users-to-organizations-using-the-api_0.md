The Provision user endpoints allow you to organize and grant permissions to your single sign-on users before the users log in to the Snyk platform. The endpoints are Provision a user to the organizaton, List pending user provisions, and Delete pending user provision.
Provisioned users do not need to accept invites. When provisioned users first log in to Snyk, they will have all their permissions. You can use the endpoint Provision a user to the organization to add users to Organizations at scale before their first login.
