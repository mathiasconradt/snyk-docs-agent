Snyk can send notifications in the following ways:

By email, if you have configured email notifications in your account settings.
By Slack, if you have set up Slack integration.

Snyk also sends you a weekly update summarizing the security status across all of your Organizations.
Snyk offers notifications for:

vulnerabilities
license issues
weekly summary report
usage alerts
report status


Setting a Project to inactive does not stop Snyk from sending notifications. You must disable notifications separately for that Project.


FedRAMP environment notifications\
Both issue alert emails and weekly report emails are disabled for FedRAMP environments. Their notification settings may be hidden from the page.
