Issue alert emails are notifications Snyk sends the day it finds a new vulnerability, license issue, or remediation.
To set the defaults for issue alert emails:

Clear the On box to turn off issue alert emails for new Projects imported into this Organization. Check the box when new Projects in this Organization should receive the defined alerts.
Check the Vulnerabilities box to set the default for all Projects in this Organization to generate alert emails for new issues or remediations.
Check the License violations box to set the default for all Projects in this Organization to generate alert emails for new license issues or remediations.
If either the Vulnerabilities or License violations boxes are checked, indicate the severity of issues for which Snyk should send alert emails by selecting All severities or Critical and high severity from the drop-down Projects list.
