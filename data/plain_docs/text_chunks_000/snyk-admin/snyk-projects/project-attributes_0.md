Project attributes are static and non-configurable fields that allow you to apply attribute values to a Project by selecting from a predefined list of values. After you have applied attributes, you can remove them from a Project as needed.
Use attributes to group, prioritize, and filter Projects. Use attributes such as lifecycle stage, business criticality, and environment to prioritize issues at a granular level. After you apply attributes to Snyk policies, you can assign policies to Projects that have those attributes applied.
