The Import Log timeline will go back as far as the most recent applicable condition of:

January 25th 2023.
The date the Organization was created.

For example, if the Organization was created before January 25th, 2023, Snyk cannot retrieve any logs before that date.
The Import Log timeline
The Import Log shows all imported targets listed in reverse chronological order, with the most recent import at the top of the page. Each import can be expanded using the dropdown, listing all the imported Projects created in Snyk at the time of import.
Targets that are in the process of being imported will have a loading icon stating Importing target.
Selecting View project will take you to the Issues tab for that specific Project.
