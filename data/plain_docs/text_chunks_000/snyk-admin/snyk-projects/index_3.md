A Snyk Project defines the items, such as manifest files, that Snyk scans for a given Target, with configuration information defining how to run that scan.
Projects appear in the Projects listing. You can also find Projects using the endpoint List all Projects for an Org with the given Org ID.
Use Group by none (ungrouped) for better Project visibility and to apply filtering attributes at the Project level.
