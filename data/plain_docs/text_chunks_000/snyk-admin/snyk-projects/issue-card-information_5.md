You can apply multiple filters to a Project to show a set of issues based on specific criteria:

Vulnerability or license issue
Issues with a specific severity
Issues within a range of the priority score
Issues that have an exploit and how mature the exploit is
Issues that are open or have been patched or ignored

You can sort the issue cards in a Project based on their priority score or severity.
