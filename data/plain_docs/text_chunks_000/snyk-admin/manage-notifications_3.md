Define the notification settings at the Group level to define the template for how Snyk sends issue alert emails, weekly report emails, usage alert emails, and report status emails for Organizations created in that Group. You also have access to the default settings for existing individual Organizations at the Group level.

Changing the Group default settings does not change the settings for existing Organizations or Projects. Individual users can override the default notification settings.

To navigate to the Group level notification settings:

Navigate to the Group overview for the Group you want to change.
