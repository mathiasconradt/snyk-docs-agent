You can import a large number of Projects into your Organizations.
Snyk recommends limiting each Organization to no more than 10,000 Projects, and does not allow more than 25,000 Projects in each Organization.
If you need more than 10,000 Projects, consider how a large number of Projects affects the experience with slower performance for listing Projects, sending notifications, displaying the dashboard, and displaying the Usage page. Also, it is difficult to delete Organizations with a large number of Projects.
While there is no limit to the overall number of Projects across all Organizations in a Group, Group-level reporting and displaying dependencies and license issues are slowed when there are several hundred thousand Projects.
