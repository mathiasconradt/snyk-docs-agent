This report is available only if you have the legacy Snyk Cloud enabled.

The Cloud Compliance Issues report shows cloud issues for an entire Organization, organized by compliance standard.
You can view a report for a single version of a compliance standard at a time, for example, CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.4.0, by selecting the desired standard from the drop-down menu. Each report includes a list of compliance controls organized by control category, with corresponding issue counts.
Selecting an issue count lets you view the list of issues associated with that control in the Cloud Issues UI, where you can view each issue in detail.
Use the information in the Cloud Compliance Issues report to investigate, triage, and fix cloud compliance issues.
