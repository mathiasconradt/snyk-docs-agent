The report presents a set of default SLA targets per severity based on common security standards, such as FedRAMP. These SLA targets can be modified to meet your own security requirements.
The SLA status of an issue can be:

Within SLA - the age of the issue has not exceeded the SLA target, and it is expected to have sufficient lead time before breaching.
At Risk - the issue is considered to be approaching an SLA breach and is flagged as “At Risk”.
Breached - the age of the issue has exceeded the SLA target.

You can control the SLA targets and the transition of issues to the “At Risk” status by editing the SLA target and setting the At risk duration before breach (days) field.

The SLA report includes additional filters under the SLA category, allowing for better identification of the age of issues in relation to the SLA target:

SLA status - allows the filtering of the report according to a specific SLA status.
Issue age - allows to discover issues within a range of age.
Time until breach - identifies issues that will breach the SLA target within days.


The report is, by default, showing only issues that are with high or critical severity. Update the severity filter if you want to view the SLA status for additional severities.
