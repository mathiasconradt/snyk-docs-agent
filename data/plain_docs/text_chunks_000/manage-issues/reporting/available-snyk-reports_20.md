The application context availability widget allows you to discover gaps in the context of assets. The available columns include:

Application Context - displays the analyzed context attribute.
Unique Values - shows how many unique instances exist for an attribute. For example, you can check how many unique applications or code owners are available for any of the listed attributes.
Availability in Repos - indicates the completeness of a certain attribute across the repositories.


Tips

Before reviewing this widget, ensure that the results are cleaned up by filtering out the "dummy" attribute values, such as "unknown", "-", and so on.\
  You can clean up the values by selecting only the relevant values.
Filtering by asset class allows you to identify business-critical repositories without a known code owner or associated application.
Filtering by the "active" value of the repository freshness filter allows you to discover context gaps in repositories that are actively being developed.
Reviewing the unique values allows you to spot gaps in context. For example, you may realize that the number of unique code owners does not match the number of teams.
