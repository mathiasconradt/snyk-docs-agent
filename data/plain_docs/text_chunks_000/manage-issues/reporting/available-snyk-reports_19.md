The repository freshness widget displays the distribution of repositories according to the last commit date:

Active: Had commits in the last 3 months.
Inactive: The last commits were made in the last 3 - 6 months.
Dormant: No commits in the last 6 months.
N/A: Commits data is unavailable.

You can use this widget to surface the quantity of repositories that are more or less maintained in various contexts, such as specific applications. 

Tips
You can use the asset class filter to identify business-critical assets that are not being maintained. Click a specific slice to open the inventory page in a new browser tab where you can browse and learn more about those assets.
