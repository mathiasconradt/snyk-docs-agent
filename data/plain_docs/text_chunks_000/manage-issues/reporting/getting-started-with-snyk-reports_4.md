You can export reports to PDF and download tabular data within a report to CSV.
Export Snyk Reports to PDF
Use the Export to PDF button at the top right to download a PDF of not only the content of a report, but also its context, including who ran the report, when it was exported, the scope being viewed (Snyk Organization or Group), and any filters applied.
Exporting a PDF allows sharing a report with a user who will not or should not authenticate into the Snyk app, such as an executive or external auditor. Export to PDF offers point-in-time attestation with the necessary context.
In tabular data on reports, only the first 50 results are shown in the PDF export. Links are provided in the PDF export to view the report in the browser.
The following is an example of a PDF export.
