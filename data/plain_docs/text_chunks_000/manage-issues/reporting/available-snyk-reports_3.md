The Vulnerabilities Detail report is similar to the Issues Detail report but shows issues grouped by Snyk Problem ID (see Snyk Vulnerability DB). 
You can easily see how many instances of a vulnerability exist and how many Projects are affected. Use this report to understand which vulnerabilities are most prevalent for both resolution and prevention use cases.
For a table of Total Issues, use Change Reports to switch to the Issues Detail report.
