The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks for web applications and is globally recognized by developers as the first step towards more secure coding. 
Each control in the list (A1, A2, and so on) is based on a list of Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). For example, A01:2021 – Broken Access Control is based on a list of 34 CWEs. 
The CWEs are mapped to Snyk-IDs (), which are mapped to issues. 
For example, the critical vulnerability SNYK-JAVA-ORGAPACHELOGGINGLOG4J-2314720 is classified as CWE-94, which is part of the OWASP TOP 10 A03:2021 - Injection. All the issues related to this vulnerability will be under the A03 category.
