The Issues Summary report highlights the value that Snyk is providing by enabling both the identification and resolution of issues. 
The report provides a glimpse into how well teams are optimizing the use of the Snyk platform for their workflow and provides a means to measure and improve security.
This report enables you to easily understand the current state and trends of the highest security risk items. This report also provides a quick view into where risk is coming from and where remediation efforts are most and least effective.
Use the date filter in the upper right corner of the Issues Summary report to see key metrics and charts for a specified interval.
This report shows a number of key metrics associated with issues in that interval with a comparison to the same metrics in the previous period so you can get a quick understanding of trends. See tooltips in the app for definitions of the metrics.
Scroll down for additional charts that show trend information in greater detail.
Key metrics are then broken down to point out information at the Organization or Project level. You can drill down to see what new and resolved issues were introduced during the date range selected.
