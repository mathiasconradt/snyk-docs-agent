In some reports, tables may include an option to modify columns. When this option is available, you can use it to select the columns to display in the UI. The export features (PDF and CSV) respect the selected columns.
When columns are modified, the app.snyk.io URL is updated to persist the state of the page, allowing for bookmarking, copying, and sharing.
