You can use the Download CSV button at the right in the report to download data presented in tables to CSV. This information can be used, for example, for prioritization purposes or a one-time analysis of data in Excel or a similar tool.
All columns displayed in the UI are included in the CSV output. In addition, any columns that contain hyperlinks in the UI are split into two columns: one containing the text and the other containing the linked URL.
There is no row limit, but there is a 5GB file size limit.
The Download CSV button is disabled if there are no vulnerabilities in the report, either because the Organization has no vulnerable projects or the filters applied remove all vulnerabilities. In this case, the report can still be exported to PDF if proof of zero vulns is required.
