| Tests preventing issues | Number of occasions when but Snyk scans of a proposed change identified potential issues, so helping prevent you introducing new vulnerabilities to your code.This occurs when your team have incorporated a pipeline or a merge scan (such as GitHub actions or PR checks) that exceed the Snyk scan thresholds.For example, if the number of Critical vulnerabilities in the change exceed the limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Ignored issues          | The total number of the issues found, but ignored, as well as the total number of ignored issues that have a fix available. These are issues not counted in any of the other totals in this Summary area.Click the number in the Ignored issues box to jump to the Issues tab, filtered to those ignored issues only. Clicking on the fixable number from the same box navigates to the Issues tab, filtered to those fixable, yet ignored, issues only.After you ignore an issue, it may take up to one hour before synchronizing with the data on the Summary tab of the Reports. |
