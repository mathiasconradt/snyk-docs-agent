The Dependencies tab acts as a Bill Of Materials (BOM) for all the direct dependencies in all of the Projects in the selected Organization. This allows you to quickly and easily identify which Projects have a specific version of a dependency.
Dependencies information is available from the Dependencies menu option - see View dependencies for more details.

For systems using legacy reporting, this information is available from the Reports menu option.
