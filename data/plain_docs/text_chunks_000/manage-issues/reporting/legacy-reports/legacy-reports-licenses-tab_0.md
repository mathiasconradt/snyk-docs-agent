The Licenses area displays all licenses currently used in your Project, a summary of all dependencies in your Projects, and a summary of all of your Projects using the license. This allows you to understand which Projects and dependencies use a license.
License information is available from the Dependencies menu option - see View licenses for more details.

For systems using legacy reporting, this information is available from the Reports menu option.
