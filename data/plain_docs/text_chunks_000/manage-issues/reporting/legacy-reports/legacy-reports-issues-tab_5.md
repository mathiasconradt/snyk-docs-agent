Issues tab actions
Search issues: search based on CVE, CWE or identifier name (i.e. DDoS). When searching by CVE or CWE, you must provide an exact value (for example CVE-1234), but when searching for identifier name, typing in a piece of the word will return results.
Issue filters: mark the issues to be displayed by selecting a range of priority scores, specific issue types, exploit maturity, status, fixable values and reachability, as described in the Issues tab elements section.
