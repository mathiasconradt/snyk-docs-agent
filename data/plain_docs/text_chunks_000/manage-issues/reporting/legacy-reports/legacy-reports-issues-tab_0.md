Overview
The Issues tab displays all known vulnerability and license discrepancies across your Organization, indicating details about each issue, which of your Projects are affected, and how you can fix each issue.

Data in each tab appears based on the filters you've applied from the top of the Reports area, as well as the Group or Organization that you're viewing from.

By default, issues are ranked by their Snyk Priority Score; you can also filter based on columns. For example, you may want to look at the highest scores with the most maturity (which are likely to have more exploits). You can also track the list of issues that got fixed.
