The asset source breakdown widget visualizes the quantities of detected assets from various sources. A source can be a platform where the asset is being managed directly (such as an SCM, container registry, and so on) or a platform that enriches the assets (such as security products and ASTs).

Tips

The widget displays the net quantities of detected assets for each source. If an asset is detected in more than one source, it will be counted once for each detected source.
When asset inventory quantities seem incomplete or exceed expectations, this widget will help you discover which integrations should be examined and potentially configured differently.
