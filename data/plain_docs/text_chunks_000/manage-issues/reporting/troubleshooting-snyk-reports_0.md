Access to reporting
If reporting is not loading in the Snyk UI, follow these troubleshooting steps that may help resolve the issue.

Allowlisting may be necessary due to some firewall settings. If allowlisting snyk.io was required for the initial implementation, additional allowlisting may be needed for new reporting access. Contact your account team for more information.

If you still have issues accessing the new reporting after using these troubleshooting tips, submit a ticket to Snyk support.
