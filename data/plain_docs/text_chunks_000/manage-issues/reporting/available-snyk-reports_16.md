The asset class breakdown widget surfaces the distribution of repositories and container images by asset class. Reviewing this widget allows you to determine the percentage of business-critical assets in your inventory and drill down to see the actual assets.

Tips

Having the context of the asset class is crucial for prioritizing assets. It is recommended to categorize your inventory by implementing classification policies to proactively classify existing and newly introduced assets.
Using the filters enables narrowing down the asset class distribution within specific applications or code owners, as well as focusing on active repositories or a set of assets based on the asset tags.
