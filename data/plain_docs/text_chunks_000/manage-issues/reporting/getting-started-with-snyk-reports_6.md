Sort columns within tables by clicking the arrows next to the column header. Click once to sort in ascending order, twice to sort in descending order and a third time to remove sort from that column. Multi-column sorting is supported.
When columns are sorted, the app.snyk.io URL is updated to persist the state of the page, allowing for bookmarking, copying, and sharing.
