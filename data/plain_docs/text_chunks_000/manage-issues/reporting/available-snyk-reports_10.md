This report shows the adoption of Snyk testing in local development through the IDE plugins and using the CLI locally. The report is available under the Change Report dropdown at the Group and Organization levels.

This report focuses on the local developer experience and thus does not include the use of CI/CD. In addition, the report does not show organizations or developers that have never used the CLI or IDE.

Security teams can use this report to demonstrate strong shift left behavior as model behavior to bring to other teams. This report also shows where teams or individual developers are not adopting Snyk locally. Companies can use this report to encourage more shift left behavior.
This report shows the test usage in the IDE and CLI by developers:
