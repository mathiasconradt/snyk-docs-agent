After a Project rescan, issues that are ignored are reflected in reporting and the rest of the Snyk platform, including APIs. Likewise, Projects for which issues have been unignored are reflected in reporting after a rescan of the Project. This does not apply to an ignore in a .snyk file.
For information about Project test frequency, see Project Settings.
