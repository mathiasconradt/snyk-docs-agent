The Asset Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your application and security controls. It displays essential data such as the status and trends of open issues, control coverage, and repository metadata. 
The Asset Dashboard is a central hub for managing and reviewing assets, making tracking inventory size easier over time and understanding the interaction between different asset types.
While Snyk Inventory enables the discovery and management of your assets that should be secured,  the Snyk Asset Dashboard allows you to go beyond the details and better understand the main building blocks of your inventory. \

The Asset Dashboard brings all the asset data that is available in your inventory and helps to answer various questions, such as:

Does my AppSec program meet the coverage requirements for business-critical assets and strategic applications?
Are the assets being classified properly according to their criticality? 
Do you know which repositories belong to which application or code owners? Are newly introduced repositories being updated with that data? 
What are the main programming languages and package managers that are used in repositories that have been worked on recently?
