You can view dependencies and license information for all Projects in your Group or Organization using the Dependencies option in your Group or Organization menu:
Dependencies tab for an Organization

When you import or re-test a Project, changes will be reflected on the Dependencies UI after a ten-second delay.

For both dependencies and licenses, you can filter by Project or other filter criteria:

Select Projects and filters


From the Projects dropdown, select specific Projects.
From the Filters dropdown, check the applicable boxes to filter by Severity level or Project type.


Results from the Dockerfile Project type are filtered out by default in the filter criteria as they can result in duplication of results from scans of the images resulting from building the Dockerfiles. To match results from API calls, either filter out Dockerfiles from the API results or turn on Dockfiles in the Project type column of the filter.
