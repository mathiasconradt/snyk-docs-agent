Remediating vulnerabilities is a crucial practice, however it slows down product development that drives companies' business. Due to this simple fact, engineering teams may neglect open vulnerabilities in favor of product development tasks.
Establishing a service-level agreement (SLA) for vulnerability remediation helps maintaining that fine balance and ensure that while moving forward with product development, evolving security risks are being addressed according to a clear and transparent policy.
SLA targets define the acceptable exposure window for a vulnerability based on factors such as severity, business criticality of the asset, code ownership, or other risk factors.
Snyk issues data enables AppSec teams to track issue aging and identify which vulnerabilities have exceeded SLA targets.
