The USAGE_EVENTS table contains CLI interactions data that is collected from Snyk's CLI interfaces (CLI, IDE plugins, CI/CD pipeline tools). The CLI interaction events can be correlated with the execution context, such as their target, org or group, utilizing the corresponding ID columns.
Querying the USAGE_EVENTS table allows to measure:
Developers' usage and adoption of Snyk IDE plugins
Snyk tests in CI/CD pipelines
Snyk CLI utilization per the different commands: test, monitor, SBOM, etc.
