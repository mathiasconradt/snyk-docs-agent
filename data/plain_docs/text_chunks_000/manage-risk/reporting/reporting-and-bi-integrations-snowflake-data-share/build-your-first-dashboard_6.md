Issue aging refers to the time elapsed between an issue’s introduction and the current date. Organizations are concerned about this metric as the exploitation likelihood increases as the exposure window extends.
To mitigate this risk, AppSec teams monitor a predefined SLA criteria, which specifies when an issue has exceeded the expected remediation timeframe.

When an issue was reintroduced, the aging is counted based on the last introduction date.
