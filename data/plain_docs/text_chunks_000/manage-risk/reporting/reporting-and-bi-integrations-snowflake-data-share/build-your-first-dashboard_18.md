Preventing vulnerabilities from reaching production involves placing security gates throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). One of the most common gates is within the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that any vulnerabilities missed in earlier stages are caught and blocked during the build process.
Leveraging Snyk Data Share enables you to assess the current adoption of tests and security gates within your CI/CD pipelines.
