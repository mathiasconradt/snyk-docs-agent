Data scope and accessibility 

The Snowflake Data Share is scoped to the data of a requested set of Snyk Groups. A customer can request access to all Snyk groups or to specific ones. 
Snyk shares all the data that is available for the requested Snyk Groups as exists in the Snyk database, with no additional limitations in the data share itself.
The data share itself is provided as a read-only database and is accessible according to Snowflake standard role-based access control.
