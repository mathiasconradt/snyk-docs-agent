The MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve) metric tracks the average time it takes to resolve a security issue. It is calculated based on issues that have already been resolved and is measured over a predefined period (typically monthly, quarterly, or annually) according to their last resolution date.
Analyzing the MTTR results provides insight into the the remediation velocity of engineering teams. However, it is important to always measure both MTTR and Aging, as issues that remain open for long periods won’t show up in the MTTR results until they are remediated.
