The PROJECTS table contains main attributes of Snyk Projects, as well as the related target. Its data can be utilized for performing aggregations of filters on the project or target levels, including based on project collections, project tags or specific repo branches (using target_ref).
Snyk Reports only presents monitored projects that were not deleted. To match your results with Snyk Reports, filter your query with IS_MONITORED = TRUE and DELETE IS NULL.
