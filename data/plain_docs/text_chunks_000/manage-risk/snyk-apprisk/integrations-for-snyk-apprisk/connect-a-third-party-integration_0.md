The Integrations page shows all active integrations, including data from your existing Snyk Organizations that are automatically synced and provides access to the Integration Hub.

The Loaded package risk factor is not supported by Snyk for operating system packages (such as Debian packages), only for packages which are hosted under package managers such as npm, Maven, or PyPI.

You can customize your AppRisk integrations from the Integrations Hub where the following integrations are available:

Veracode SAST
Checkmarx SAST 
SonarQube
Nightfall
GitGuardian
Dynatrace
Sysdig


Data synchronization may take up to two hours after receiving the Connected status from a new integration setup. See the Integration connected statuses page for more details.

After you finish setting up an integration, you can see it listed with a Connected status.
