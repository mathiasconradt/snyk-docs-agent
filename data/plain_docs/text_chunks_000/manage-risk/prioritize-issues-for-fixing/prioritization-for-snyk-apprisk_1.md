The evidence graph is available only for Snyk AppRisk users and only at the Group level. 
The Snyk approach looks holistically at your application to understand the following:

What source code and dependencies were built into a container image
The operating system it is running on
Where the image was deployed
How the supporting Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure is configured
