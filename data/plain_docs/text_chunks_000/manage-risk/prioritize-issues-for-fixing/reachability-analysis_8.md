Snyk aims to identify and demonstrate when a code element is reachable, while also addressing the challenges of indicating that a code element cannot be reached.   
Static analysis techniques can show that a vulnerability or code element can be reached through at least one execution path. However, just because there is no evidence of this does not mean that the element cannot be reached. 
A code element that is not marked as reachable may still be accessible under conditions that were not considered during analysis. This can occur due to incomplete information, control flow issues, potential dynamic behaviors, or overlooked edge cases.
Reachability is an important factor in assessing security risks. When evaluating these risks, consider both reachable issues and those that are not reachable. This helps you evaluate security risks as a whole, making sure you do not overlook any potential threats.
