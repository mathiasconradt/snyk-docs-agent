The Funnel view is available only to Snyk AppRisk users.

The funnel view is a visual representation of your application's issues and risk factors. It allows you to filter the list of issues by specific risk factors or a combination of them. The Deployed and Public facing risk factors are clickable filters.

The OS Condition risk factor is now available only in the table view of the Issues UI.
