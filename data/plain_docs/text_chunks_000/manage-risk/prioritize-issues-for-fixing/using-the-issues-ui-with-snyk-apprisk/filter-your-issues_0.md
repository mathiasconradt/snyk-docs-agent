On the Issues page, the Set up Insights option, the Funnel view, the Risk Factor filter, and column are available only to Snyk AppRisk users.

Snyk AppRisk operates at the Group level and provides a holistic view of all the issues within that Group. Those issues are also tied to specific Organizations. Use the top-level filter to choose which Organizations are relevant to you and see only the issues in those Organizations.
