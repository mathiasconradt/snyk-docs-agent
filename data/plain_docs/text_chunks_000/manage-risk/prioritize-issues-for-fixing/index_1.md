Prioritize the Projects
Prioritize the Projects from your repositories by the type of Projects you want to focus on, for example, prioritize your Projects depending on their severity.
With this type of prioritization, you can group, filter, and sort your Projects.
Prioritize Projects based on these filters:

With issues: displays only Projects with issues.
Without issues: displays only Projects without issues.
Integrations: displays the integrated Git repositories imported to Snyk.

You can use this type of prioritization with any of the following Snyk Plans: 

Snyk Free/Team Plan
Snyk Enterprise Plan
Snyk Essentials
Snyk AppRisk 

You can prioritize your Projects at the Snyk Group level and Snyk Organization level.
