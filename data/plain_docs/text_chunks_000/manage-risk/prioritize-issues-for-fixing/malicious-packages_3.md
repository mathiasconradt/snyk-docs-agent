Usually, open-source vulnerabilities are assigned a CVE ID, for example, CVE-2021-44228. The CVE ID helps security vendors like Snyk identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. In almost all cases, malicious packages are not assigned a CVE ID. The absence of this identifier makes sharing new threats in the security community difficult. Snyk uses the name of the package, the package registry, for example, npm, and the affected version range to publicly catalog and share the malicious packages.
