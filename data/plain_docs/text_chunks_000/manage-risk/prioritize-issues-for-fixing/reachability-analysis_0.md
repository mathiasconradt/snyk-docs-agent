Release status
Reachability is now in General Availability (GA) status for certain integrations and programming languages.
 Snyk is expanding its reachability capabilities by adding more integrations and languages, which are available in Early Access and can be enabled through Snyk Preview.

Snyk reachability analysis allows you to analyze risk by identifying whether your application is calling a code element (e.g. functions, classes, modules, annotations, etc.) related to the vulnerability, thus raising the chances of that vulnerability being exploited in the context of your application.
Reachability analysis can be used as a standalone signal to make decisions, or as part of a broader risk-based prioritization approach using the Snyk Risk Score. 
Snyk uses a combination of program analysis and various AI techniques to determine the reachability of a given vulnerability, with validation conducted by security research experts.
The following instructions explain how to set up and use reachability analysis and provide more information on how the underlying analysis works at Snyk.
