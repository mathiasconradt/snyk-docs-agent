Risk Score helps you apply holistic risk-based prioritization that combines multiple factors,  associated with either the vulnerability or the context of your application. Reachability analysis is such a contextual factor that will significantly increase the overall score. 
Risk Score is available on the Projects page and through the API and Reports. 
Reachability as part of the Risk Score

Priority score, the legacy model preceding the Risk Score, also takes reachable vulnerabilities into account.
