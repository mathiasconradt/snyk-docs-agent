The Snyk Risk Score Model
The model that powers the Risk Score applies automatic risk analysis for each security issue based on the potential impact and likelihood of exploitability.

The Risk model results from extensive research conducted by the Snyk Security Data Science team and experienced security researchers. The model draws on expertise gained over the years in developing the Snyk Vulnerability Database.
