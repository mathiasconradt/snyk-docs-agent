A dependency confusion attack is a tactic used by attackers who upload malicious packages with private package names to public package registries. The result of this is confusion of automatic processes that import packages, for example, IDE and CIs, so these processes download the public package instead of the intended private one.
For example, ACME Corporation developed an internal UI package and named it acme-ui, and hosted it in a private package registry. 
A malicious user published a malicious package with the same name to npm. A developer at ACME did not configure the environment to pull packages from the private registry. While installing packages, the developer mistakenly downloaded the acme-ui package from the public registry instead of the private one, allowing the malicious user to run code on the developer's machine, a successful instance of dependency confusion.
