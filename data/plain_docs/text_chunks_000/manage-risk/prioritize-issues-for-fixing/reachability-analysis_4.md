Reachability status 
After a vulnerability is identified, it has one of the following reachability statuses:

REACHABLE - A direct or indirect path was found from your application to the vulnerable code.
NO PATH FOUND - No path found from your application to the vulnerable code.


If a NO PATH FOUND status is given, do not assume that the vulnerability is totally unreachable or unexploitable.

Reachability analysis status is available on the Project page, as part of the Risk Score, in the Issues Detail report, and through the API endpoint  Get issues by Group ID.
