Malicious packages are a popular and growing method of carrying out software supply chain attacks. This page explains what malicious packages are, how Snyk identifies them, and what customers should do if they have malicious packages in their Projects.

Snyk does not consider the provenance or origin of a scanned package. In some cases, Snyk may detect false positives when the ecosystem, name, and version of a scanned package match a malicious public package.
Ensure you verify the provenance of your packages.
