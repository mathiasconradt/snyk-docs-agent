Information about the existence and status of an exploit is collected from various sources.
The security analysts at Snyk curate information on new exploits and an automated process explores structured and unstructured data from multiple exploit sources.
Examples of structured data are the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog by CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) Exploit DB. Examples of unstructured data include blogs, forums, and social media sites like X (formerly known as Twitter).
