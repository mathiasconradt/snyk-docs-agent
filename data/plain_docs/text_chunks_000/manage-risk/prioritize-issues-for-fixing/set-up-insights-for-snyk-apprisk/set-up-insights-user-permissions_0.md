The Set up Insights option is available only with Snyk AppRisk.

Snyk AppRisk is available at the Group level, so grant relevant users the Group viewer or the Organization Collaborator role. This is the minimum required permission, but Group Admins can also view Prioritization.
After you have the right permission, you will see a new Issues UI option in the left navigation at the Group level. On the Issues page, you can also see two tabs, one for viewing and customizing your Issues, and one to Set up Insights.
