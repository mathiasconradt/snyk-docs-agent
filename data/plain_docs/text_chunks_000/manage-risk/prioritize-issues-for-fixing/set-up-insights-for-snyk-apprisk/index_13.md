Each of these integration options uses different risk factors:

Snyk Runtime Sensor: Deployed and Loaded Package
Kubernetes Connector: Deployed, Public facing
Third-party Integrations: Deployed and Loaded Package

By leveraging these integration options, you can ensure comprehensive coverage and accurate prioritization of security risks.
The Deployed and Loaded Package risk factors offer more specific and actionable insights into the actual state and behavior of your applications, enabling better prioritization and remediation efforts.
The Public facing risk factor is less commonly used in all available integration options because it covers broader, more external threats that are harder to quantify and track within an internal monitoring system.
