The Insights settings are organized into three main categories:

Risk factors - allows you to enable or disable the risk factors involved in calculating the risk of your identified issues. 
Provider selection - allows you to configure the Kubernetes runtime providers.
Kubernetes cluster mapping - allows you to match the clusters identified by providers with the preferred names.

All these settings can be found in the Snyk Web UI, under Group Settings, the Settings option.
