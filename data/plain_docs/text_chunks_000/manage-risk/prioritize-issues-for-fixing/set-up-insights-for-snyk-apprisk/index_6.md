Snyk recommends that you also perform the following steps to get the maximum value out of insights:

Scan the third-party dependencies using Snyk Open Source,
Scan the source code using Snyk Code
Start with one application and expand from there

By scanning both the source code and the third-party dependencies, you will get risk factors data, which provides the application context to better prioritize your open issues.
