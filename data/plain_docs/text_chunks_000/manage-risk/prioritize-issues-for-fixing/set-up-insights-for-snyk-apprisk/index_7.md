Snyk recommends installing the Snyk Runtime Sensor to achieve the most effective integration and access its continuously expanded set of features.

The major steps in setting up issues are as follows:

Grant users the Group Viewer role or the Organization Collaborator role. See Prioritization setup: User permissions.
Create the required Organization, roles, and permissions, and deploy the agent. See Prioritization setup: Kubernetes Connector.


The Kubernetes Connector is different from the Kubernetes Controller, Snyk-Monitor.


Scan your images properly so Snyk has access to the right data. See Prioritization setup: Image scanning.
Set up the required link for the application on which you want to use prioritization. See Prioritization setup: Associating Snyk Open Source, Code, and Container Projects.
Set up third-party runtime integrations or the Snyk Runtime Sensor to get even more runtime data.
To ensure you have properly set up the prioritization capability, navigate to the Set up Snyk AppRisk tab on the Issues page and view the data Snyk has access to.\
   You can also filter relevant sections by Organization for a granular view of your progress.


The Insights page, from the Set up Insights tab, is available only for Snyk AppRisk users.
