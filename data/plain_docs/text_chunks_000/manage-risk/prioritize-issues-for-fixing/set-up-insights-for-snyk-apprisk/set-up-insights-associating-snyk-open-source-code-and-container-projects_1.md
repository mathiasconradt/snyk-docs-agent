Add Snyk Project tags to all the Projects used by your application to link these Projects together and allow Snyk to represent the whole application that you are testing. 
To associate two Projects together, add the exact same tag to both Projects. For example, add the same tag to your Snyk Open Source Projects and Snyk Container Project if they are related to each other. 
See the examples at the end of this section.
