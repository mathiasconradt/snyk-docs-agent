Vulnerabilities that are not exploitable are unlikely to pose a security threat to your application and can therefore be de-prioritized for fixing.
Every vulnerability has conditions that must be met for the vulnerability to pose a threat, that is, to be exploitable.
Examples of vulnerable conditions include conditions that meet any of the following criteria:

Require a user interaction
Have a specific port number open
Require a certain CPU architecture
Enable a specific setting

Some vulnerabilities have multiple different conditions that must all be met for that vulnerability to be exploitable. A vulnerable open-source package can be exploited in some applications but not in others.
Exploitability depends on the context. Examples of context include the environment, the settings, and how the developer uses a package.
