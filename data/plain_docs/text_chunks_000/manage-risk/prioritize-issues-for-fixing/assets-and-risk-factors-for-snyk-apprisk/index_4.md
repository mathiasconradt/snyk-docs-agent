By understanding your images, packages, and Kubernetes resources as "application context", Snyk can compute the following risk factors:

Deployed
Loaded package
OS condition
Public facing

You can enable and disable all of these "application context" risk factors through the Group Settings, on the Issues UI tab. If you choose to disable a risk factor, a provider selection, or the Kubernetes cluster mapping, Snyk will no longer compute them. 

The Risk Factors are available only for Snyk AppRisk.

Depending on the integration options enabled for your application, risk factors are applied differently. You can prioritize your integrations by customizing the available Insights options from the Group settings.
Group settings - Insights tab in the Group settings

Risk factor settings may take up to four hours to take effect.
