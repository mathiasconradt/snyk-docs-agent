The OS condition risk factor is available only for Snyk AppRisk users.

Some vulnerabilities have specific constraints that must be met for the problem to be exploitable. One such constraint is the operating system. Some vulnerabilities are exploitable only when the affected package is executing on a specific operating system, for example, Windows. Snyk can compare the vulnerability condition specified in the package with the operating system used by the runtime environment executing the package.
