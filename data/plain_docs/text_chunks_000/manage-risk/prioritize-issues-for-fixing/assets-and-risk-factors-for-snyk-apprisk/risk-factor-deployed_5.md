The Snyk Runtime Sensor applies the Deployed risk factor by constantly monitoring the active containers within a Kubernetes cluster. It does this by capturing real-time Kubernetes events and taking hourly snapshots of the cluster's state. These real-time data and snapshots help identify which images are currently being deployed. By comparing this information with Snyk Projects and known vulnerabilities, the Snyk Runtime Sensor accurately assesses deployed risks. This ensures that security insights are up-to-date and reflect the current deployment environment.
