Kubernetes resources are assets that represent a Kubernetes object. The Kubernetes Connector collects resource information from the Kubernetes clusters. 
Kubernetes resources do not map to the Snyk Projects. These are internal entities used to compute certain risk factors, further detailed on the rest of this page. These risk factors can be related to the packages and images.
