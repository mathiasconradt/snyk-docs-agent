The capabilities of the SnykWeb UI Issues menu rely on understanding your application context to help you better prioritize your security issues. It does that by understanding how your application is configured and relying on that information to provide you with triage and prioritization of your assets and issues for the Snyk Essentials plan, and it also adds specific risk factors and evidence graph information for the Snyk AppRisk plan. 

Assets are analyzed using Snyk Issues, focusing on images, Kubernetes resources, and packages to understand how they all interact with each other.
Risk factors are analyzed using Snyk Issues and grouped into four main categories: 
Deployed 
Loaded package 
OS conditions 
Public facing
