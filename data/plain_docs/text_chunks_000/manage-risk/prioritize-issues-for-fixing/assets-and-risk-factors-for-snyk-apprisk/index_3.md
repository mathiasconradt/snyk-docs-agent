Packages are assets that represent a software package. Snyk Open Source and Snyk Code products perform security scans on files. These files represent the package manager declaration and the source code of a software package, respectively. A package is a representation of that software package.
Packages can be mapped one to one with the Snyk Projects created by the scans performed by Snyk Open Source and Snyk Code. All the issues identified by these products and attributed to these Projects will be mapped to the package entity. 
The term Package is a very coarse abstraction. It does not have versions. It is a representation of the current state of the software package at a point in time. The point in time is determined by the time when the Snyk processing pipeline is completed and the state of Snyk Projects at that time. 
Snyk Open Source uses the word package to refer to the third-party dependencies declared in the package dependency manifest. Snyk does not currently expose the granularity of the third-party dependencies. However, from the prioritization data model point of view, there is no distinction between third-party and first-party packages. These would be represented as a package object at that point in time.
