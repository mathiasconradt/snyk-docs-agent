Images
Images are assets that represent a Docker image. Snyk Container performs security scans on the Docker images. Images can be mapped one to many with the Snyk Projects created by the scans performed by Snyk Container. Docker images have natural IDs, which are represented by SHAs. Snyk uses this natural ID to correlate the same images even if they are mapped to different Snyk Projects.
