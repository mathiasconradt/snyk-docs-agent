The Loaded package risk factor works with the Snyk Runtime Sensor and third-party integrations.
Snyk Runtime Sensor
The Snyk Runtime Sensor improves the identification and management of loaded package risks by providing real-time data on packages loaded into memory within Kubernetes containers. It closely integrates with your runtime environment to continuously monitor active packages and cross-reference this information with known vulnerabilities. This dynamic approach ensures accurate application of the loaded package risk factor, using up-to-date data to prioritize and mitigate risks based on actual runtime conditions.

Navigate to the Snyk Runtime Sensor documentation to learn more about the supported ecosystems from which the Loaded package risk factor is reported.
