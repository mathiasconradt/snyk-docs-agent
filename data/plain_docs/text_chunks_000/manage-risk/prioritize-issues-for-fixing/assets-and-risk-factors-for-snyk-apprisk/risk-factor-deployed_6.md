The Deployed risk factor is extended to third-party integrations through real-time monitoring of Kubernetes clusters, along with data from external sources. This enables a comprehensive assessment of deployed risks across diverse environments. By integrating with third-party tools, Snyk can cross-reference vulnerabilities from various sources, ensuring that the deployed risk factor reflects the most accurate and current threat landscape. This holistic approach allows Snyk to provide actionable insights and maintain robust security postures across all integrated platforms.
