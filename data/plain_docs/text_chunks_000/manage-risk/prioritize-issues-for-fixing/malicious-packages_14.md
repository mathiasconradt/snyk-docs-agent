A “security holding” on a package means that the package contained malicious code and was removed from the registry by the npm Security Team. A security placeholder was published to ensure users are not affected in the future. Although the package is currently under a “security holding” placeholder, it is important to verify that it was not imported from npm before it was marked in this placeholder. After you confirm that all instances of this package were downloaded from a private registry, you can ignore the issue.
The Snyk Vulnerability Database also shows packages in a “Security Holding” state, for example, the flatmap-stream package.
