Priority Score helps teams quickly identify and address critical security vulnerabilities by ranking them based on urgency. 
Priority Score is determined based on a number of industry-standard criteria:

CVSS score
trending vulnerabilities
reachability
availability of exploits
other factors

You can use this type of prioritization with any of the following Snyk Plans: 

Snyk Free/Team Plan
Snyk Enterprise Plan

You can use the Priority Score at the Snyk Organization level.
