Feature availability\
This feature is available only for the Java (Gradle and Maven) ecosystem when you use GitHub as the source and Snyk Code is enabled.

In the context of your application, the Triage Assistant evaluates the vulnerable conditions, which helps you determine the exploitability of your application.
‌Snyk Code (SAST) engine is used to read your first-party code and to check the conditions for the vulnerabilities found by Snyk Open Source (SCA).

To provide this feature, Snyk takes a temporary copy of your Git repository contents.
For more information, see How Snyk handles your data.
