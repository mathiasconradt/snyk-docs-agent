Use severity levels to help you with vulnerability assessment for your applications. Severity levels indicate the assessed level of risk, as Critical, High, Medium, or Low. Snyk reports the number of vulnerabilities at each level of severity in many places in the Snyk application. The display varies; a typical example follows.


Severity levels also apply to license issues. See Licenses.

The severity levels are defined in the following table.
