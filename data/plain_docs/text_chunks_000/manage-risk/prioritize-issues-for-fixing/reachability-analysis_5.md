After you import  or test a Project using the Snyk UI, the Project is monitored by Snyk, and the results of the reachable vulnerabilities analysis appear on the Project page in the following places:

Filters - Allow you to focus first on reachable vulnerabilities by filtering results based on reachability.
Reachability badge - Allows you to quickly see on the issue card when a vulnerability is reachable.
Call path - Allows you to see the path from your code to the vulnerable code element to validate the result.
