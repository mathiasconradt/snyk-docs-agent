At present, Snyk Open Source and Snyk Container scanners are unable to differentiate between internal and external packages, meaning that they cannot determine if a package has been imported from a public or a private registry. This capability will be added in the future. Meanwhile, you might see inaccurate alerts related to packages imported from a private registry.
A Snyk alert is a warning that an attack has targeted the organization, not an implication that the organization published the malware.
Several ecosystems have started implementing support for verifying attestations. The public npm registry, for instance, provides support for package provenance. The more that maintainers adopt this feature and publish packages with provenance details, the more secure and better the ways to validate package provenance become. Snyk highly recommends you start planning readiness for this in your open-source package consumption strategies.
An internal package may be flagged as malicious. If this happens, it means that a package with a similar name was published on a public registry, most likely with malicious code. This publication was intended to make developers in your company import the malicious public package, either by automatic or manual processes, instead of importing the legitimate private package.
Avoid malicious packages by always verifying the npm registry source.
