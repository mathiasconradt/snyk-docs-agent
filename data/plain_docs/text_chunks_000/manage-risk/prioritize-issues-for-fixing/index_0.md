You can find prioritization within Snyk under several names and with different customizations depending on your Snyk plan. The following list presents an overview of all the places where you can find and use prioritization. The outputs can vary depending on the type of priority you choose to use. 

Prioritization at the Project level
Prioritization within Reporting
Prioritization based on risk
Prioritization based on coverage and security program

You can focus solely on one type of prioritization, or you can combine them for a more complex and targeted focus on the issues that require your immediate attention. You can use prioritization for your vulnerabilities, your security program, and your coverage (from a security perspective), or you can use it in the Reporting section of your Projects.\

For example, if you only prioritize the Projects from your repositories, then the list of issues is more general. However, if you choose to use prioritization with Issues, available for Snyk Essentials, the analyzed issues are filtered through several other factors (risk factors, assets) all contributing to the creation of an issues priority list based on more complex and targeted filters, allowing you to customize the prioritization based on your needs.
