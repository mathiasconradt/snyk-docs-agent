Risk Score assesses the potential impact of vulnerabilities, prioritizing those with severe consequences. You can use the Risk Score to perform automatic risk analysis for each security issue based on the potential impact and likelihood of exploitability.
You can use this type of prioritization with any of the following Snyk Plans: 

Snyk Free/Team Plan
Snyk Enterprise Plan
Snyk  Essentials
Snyk AppRisk 

You can use the Risk Score at the Snyk Organization level.
