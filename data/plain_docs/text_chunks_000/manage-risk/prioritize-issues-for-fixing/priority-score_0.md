The Snyk Priority Score is a single value assigned to an issue, to help you quickly and easily decide which issues are most important to fix. Scores range from 0 to 1,000; the higher the score, the more important it is to fix that issue.
The Snyk Priority Score is determined based on a number of industry-standard criteria, including CVSS score, trending vulnerabilities, reachability, availability of exploits, and other factors. These factors yield scores with a high degree of granularity. This granularity avoids having many issues with the same score, allowing you to determine the importance of an issue quickly and accurately.

Snyk does not use the CVSS score alone to determine priority; other factors are also considered.

See Calculation of Priority Score for detailed information on how scores are determined.
You can view Priority Scores in Projects views, Reports, and the API.
