The Common Configuration Scoring System (CCSS), developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and derived from CVSS, measures the severity of software security configuration issues.
Snyk uses the CCSS to designate the characteristics and severity of IaC+ vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
| Level | CCSS score |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Critical  | 9.0 - 10.0     |
| High      | 7.0 - 8.9      |
| Medium    | 4.0 - 6.9      |
| Low       | 0.0 - 3.9      |
The severity level and score are determined based on the CCSS Base Score calculations using the Base Metrics.
