Priority Score and Risk Score prioritization
You can use both Priority and Risk Scores as a prioritization tool when you are using the Reporting option from the Snyk Web UI and you select the desired Projects from the filters list. 
The Priority Score focuses on urgency and ranks security issues based on various criteria, such as CVSS score, trending vulnerabilities, reachability, availability of exploits, and other factors. On the other hand, the Risk Score assesses the overall risk associated with vulnerabilities by considering both their severity and the context of the application, such as the likelihood of exploitation and the potential impact on the system. While the Priority Score assists teams in addressing the most urgent threats, the Risk Score offers a comprehensive view of the security posture.
