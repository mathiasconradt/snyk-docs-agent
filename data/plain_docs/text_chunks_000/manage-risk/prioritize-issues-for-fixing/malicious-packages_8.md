Bad actors publish malicious packages to a registry, hoping to trick users into installing them. An example of a typosquatting attack is crossenv. The attacker used a name similar to the popular package, cross-env, and even wrapped the exact same functionality as the original module to convey that the module is indeed working as expected. However, the module captured environment variables and sent them to an attacker-controlled remote server.
