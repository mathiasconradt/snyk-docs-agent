Malicious packages may be publicly available for only a few minutes until identified and taken down. In other cases, a malicious package can be included in a targeted supply chain infection campaign and go unnoticed for months or years. 
While research and defense capabilities improve, attackers use novel techniques and technologies to overcome their findings. Users may notice that a Snyk advisory was published recently, despite the malicious package's being in the wild for a long time.
