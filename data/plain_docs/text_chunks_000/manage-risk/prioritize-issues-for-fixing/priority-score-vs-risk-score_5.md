Imagine a scenario where your Organization uses a widely popular web application platform, which has recently been identified as having several security vulnerabilities. Due to limited resources, you may not be able to address all issues right away. Prioritization scores are crucial. Your team patches critical vulnerabilities first to mitigate the most significant threats to the security of your Organization.
You can focus on using the Priority score if you also want to scan the source code from Snyk Code, besides Snyk Open Source and Snyk Container.\
The Priority score focuses on the impact and means of remediating a vulnerability. 
Scan your source code and apply the following filters to your list of found vulnerabilities:

Issue type: Vulnerabilities
Severity: Critical
Fixed in available: Yes
Computed fixability: Fixable
Exploit maturity: Mature
