The Risk Score assesses security threats based on their potential impact and likelihood, allowing for more nuanced vulnerability management.

Comprehensive Risk Assessment - Use the Risk Score to assess both exploitability and potential damage when evaluating vulnerabilities.
Long-Term Security Planning - Identifies and prioritizes potential risks, assisting in planning future security infrastructure improvements.
Stakeholder Communication - The Risk Score is a metric that communicates security risks to non-technical stakeholders, aiding informed decisions on security investments.

The Risk Score helps balance immediate threat mitigation with long-term security posture, creating a comprehensive approach to managing vulnerabilities.
The assessment model used by the Risk score focuses on two factors:

Impact - the possibility of a fix to address multiple vulnerabilities.
Likelihood - the probability for a vulnerability to be exploited in a user's code.
