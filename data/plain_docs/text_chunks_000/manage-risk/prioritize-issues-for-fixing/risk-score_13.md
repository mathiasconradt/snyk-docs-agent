Represents the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible, based on the CVSS definition.
| Possible input values | Score impact                                                                                               |

| Network             | Likelihood subscore increases.                                                                             |
| Adjacent            | Likelihood subscore decreases according to the level of remote access needed to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Local               | Likelihood subscore decreases according to the level of remote access needed to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Physical            | Likelihood subscore decreases according to the level of remote access needed to exploit the vulnerability. |
