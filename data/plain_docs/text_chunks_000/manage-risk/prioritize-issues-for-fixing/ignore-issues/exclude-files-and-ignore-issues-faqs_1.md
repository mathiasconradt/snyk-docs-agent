Q: How do I ignore issues and vulnerabilities in Code (SAST) scans?

To ignore a code vulnerability, import the Project into the Snyk UI, and use the ignore button. 
You cannot use the .snyk file to ignore issues in Code scans.
The snyk-to-html tool will display all issues for Code scans whether the issues are ignored or not.
