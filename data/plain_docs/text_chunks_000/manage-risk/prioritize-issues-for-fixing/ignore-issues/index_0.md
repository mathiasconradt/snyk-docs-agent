You can ignore a vulnerability or open-source license issue if you do not need to fix it and want to avoid seeing the issue in scan results. You can ignore issues temporarily or permanently and set ignores individually or as actions. By using Snyk ignores you can display results only for issues you need to fix
 For Open Source details, see How to set ignores. This information provides a useful background for using ignores with other Snyk scanning methods. For more information, see the following sections on this page:
