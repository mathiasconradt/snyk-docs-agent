How the Project was imported: through an SCM integration, or through the CLI or an IDE
The scanning method being used: Open Source, Code, Container, or IaC
How the test is being done, in the UI, or through the CLI or an IDE
How the exclude or ignore was set: in a policy, through the UI or the API, or in the .snyk file
