Suppressing vulnerabilities carries a level of risk, so you can make this function available to admins only as follows:

Navigate to your Organization Settings, then General, then navigate to the Ignores section.
Under Ability to ignore an issue or edit the ignore settings on an issue, select Admin users only.\
   This also prevents ignores from being added through the CLI.
Under Require reason for each ignore, you can set the more details field to be required when an issue is being ignored, so the user must enter a reason for each ignore.
Select Update to make the changes.

Update ignore settings

The Admin users only Ignore setting applies only to Snyk Organization Admins. This setting is not compatible with custom roles or Group Admins.
