The Priority Score tool helps manage vulnerabilities by prioritizing the most urgent issues based on exploitability, ease of mitigation, and potential for exploitation. Use it to first address the critical vulnerabilities and if you want to prioritize the Snyk Code issues (since Risk score is not available for Snyk Code).

Time-Sensitive Projects - When you are working on Projects with tight deadlines, it is important to address security concerns right away. 
Initial Triage - Priority score quickly identifies and mitigates immediate threats from multiple vulnerabilities.
Resource Allocation - Teams can allocate security resources to promptly address urgent risks.

Priority Score helps your team quickly prioritize and address urgent Project vulnerabilities to reduce the risk of attacks.
The assessment model used by the Priority score focuses on two factors:

Impact - Snyk analyses the possibility of a fix to address multiple vulnerabilities. The Priority score increases exponentially with the number of vulnerabilities addressed by a fix.
Actionability - Snyk analyses how easy it is to remediate a vulnerability.
