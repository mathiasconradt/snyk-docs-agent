Transitive depth 
Building on past studies, Snyk research has shown that if a vulnerability is introduced to a Project transitively rather than directly, it is less likely that an exploitable function path will exist.
| Possible input values | Score impact                         |

| Direct dependency   | Likelihood subscore does not change. |
| Indirect dependency | Likelihood subscore decreases.       |
