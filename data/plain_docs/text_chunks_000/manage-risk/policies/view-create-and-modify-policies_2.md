Each policy category has a default policy. Default policies can be applied only to Organizations, not Project attributes.
When you create a new Organization, it will automatically be added to the default policy unless you have copied the settings of an existing Organization. You can assign an Organization to a different policy if desired.
The default policy cannot be deleted; however, the default policy name, description, and rules can be edited to match your preferences. A default policy can also contain no rules if you'd prefer.
See Assign a policy to an Organization for details.
The Policy Manager allows you to create, edit, and duplicate or delete a policy.
