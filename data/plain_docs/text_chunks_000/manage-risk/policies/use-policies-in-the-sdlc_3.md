Using a process similar to the one in the previous example, you can define a security policy to automatically ignore all Medium severity vulnerabilities in the FrontEnd environment without a known exploit:

Snyk security policy - specify vulnerabilities to ignore

This policy is now assigned to all Projects with the selected attributes applied and takes effect the next time Snyk scans those Projects.
See Security policies for more details.
