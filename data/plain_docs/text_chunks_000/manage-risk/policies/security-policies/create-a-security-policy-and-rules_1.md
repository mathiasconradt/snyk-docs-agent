Security policy rules are in the “if, then” format with one or more conditions and an action. An example follows:

Security policy rule format with plus sign to add a rule and three dots top right


When you create a new security policy, the first blank rule is created automatically.

Select the conditions and actions to complete a rule. See Security policy conditions and Security policy actions for details.

To add a new blank rule, click on the plus sign beneath the previous rule.
To delete or duplicate a rule, click the three dots at the top right of the rule box.


The order of the rules you create sets the precedence. If there is a conflict, the rule closest to the top takes precedence over any subsequent rules.
