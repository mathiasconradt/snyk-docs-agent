Feature availability
Policies are available only with Snyk Enterprise plans and apply only to Snyk Open Source scans. 
For more information, see plans and pricing.
The.snyk file is a policy file that Snyk uses to define specific analysis behaviors for Open Source, Snyk Code, and Snyk IaC. and to specify patches for the CLI and CI/CD plugins. See The .snyk file for details.

Snyk policies contain rules to define how Snyk behaves when encountering specific types of Open Source issues. With policies, you can identify types of issues based on conditions, such as no exploit available, and then apply actions to these issues, such as changing the severity. Thus by using customizable Snyk policies, you can define actions for specific types of issues encountered in scanning.
Snyk Policy manager
Using the Snyk Policy Manager, you can view, create, and edit policies. For details, see View, create, and modify policies.
