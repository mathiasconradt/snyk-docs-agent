The Unknown license type indicates Snyk has not recognized a license for a given package version. You can set a severity level for Unknown, for example, to ensure these license issues are given a higher severity and so appear more prominently in results.
Scroll down the licenses list on the right of the policy you are editing, then select the Severity dropdown for the Unknown license type:
Set severity for Unknown license type

Snyk applies the severity level set for Unknown to new licenses when Snyk adds them to your license policy.
