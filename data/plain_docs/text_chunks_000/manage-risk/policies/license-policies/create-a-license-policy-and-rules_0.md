Feature availability
License policies are available only with Enterprise plans and apply only to Snyk Open Source scans. For more information, see plans and pricing.

Group administrators can configure the following settings for each license:

Level of severity: Values include None, Low, Medium, and High.
When None is selected, instructions cannot be inserted since licenses marked with None do not appear in any Snyk test results.
New licenses added by Snyk inherit the Unknown license type severity. In cases where this severity is not set to None, newly added licenses appear in Snyk test results.
Legal instructions for developers: Enter free text to provide any necessary instructions for developers.
Snyk recommends describing the specific policy of your company, explaining the need for collaboration from your developers as well as providing them with step-by-step instructions if any are needed
Legal instructions will appear in the CLI results, in PR Checks, and on issue cards in the Project view
