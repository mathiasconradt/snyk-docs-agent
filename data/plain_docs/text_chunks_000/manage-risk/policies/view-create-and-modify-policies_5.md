To duplicate or delete a policy, click the three dots on the right-hand side:

Duplicate or delete a policy

Duplicating a policy copies the rules of a policy but not the assigned Organizations or Projects. The new policy is automatically called Copy of (Policy Name)… and can be edited as explained in Edit a policy.

Deleting a policy cannot be undone. If you delete a policy with Organizations assigned to it, those Organizations will return to the default policy.
