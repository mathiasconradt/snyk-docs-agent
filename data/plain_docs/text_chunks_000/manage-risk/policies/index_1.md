Policies give you a quick and automated way to identify and triage issues that are irrelevant to or unimportant in your application development. This reduces the noise level, saving valuable development time and allowing developers to take more responsibility for and ownership of security.
Policies help prioritize issues to address and can ensure vulnerable or non-compliant components do not escape notice. Policies are part of the governance framework of your company.
