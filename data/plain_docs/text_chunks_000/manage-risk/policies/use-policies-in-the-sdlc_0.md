You can apply policies across all stages of the SDLC, from the developer’s local development environment, in the IDE or CLI, through to Git-based workflows and CI/CD, and into production.
These multiple security and compliance controls ensure issues are flagged as early as possible in the development process when it is least costly and time-consuming to fix them.

In addition, the .snyk file is a policy file that Snyk uses to define certain analysis behaviors and to specify patches for the CLI and CI/CD plugins. See The .snyk file for details
