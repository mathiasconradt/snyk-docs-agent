You can use the Coverage filter to verify if an asset has ever been tested by the product and the Coverage gap filter to verify if the asset meets the coverage requirements set in a Set coverage control policy.

The Coverage Gap filter is not the opposite of the Coverage filter. 
An asset can be covered (if it was scanned a month ago) but, at the same time, can still have a coverage gap, if the requirement is a daily scan.

The following video presents an overview of the coverage and coverage gap filters from the Snyk Web UI.
