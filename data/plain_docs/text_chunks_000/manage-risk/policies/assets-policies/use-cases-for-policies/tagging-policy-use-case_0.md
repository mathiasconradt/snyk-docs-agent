Tagging policy
Categorize and label repository assets with asset tags. You can use the Set Asset Tag action to mark the repositories to which the filter criteria you have set apply. 
Snyk Essentials has a number of pre-defined system tags that can be used for filtering and setting tags with policies. User-defined custom tags can be created using policies. You can create a Set Asset Tag policy action and define a custom tag by typing your tag in the tag search bar and selecting Create new: tag_name, for this example the tag_name being payment.

The following use case demonstrates how to apply the custom-defined backend tag to assets that match certain naming conventions. This allows a quick filter for backend assets from the Inventory view.
This is how the policy should look after you finish setting up all filters and actions.
