Notify members of the AppSec team when new assets meeting certain criteria are discovered. For example, you may send a Slack message to the infra team if new repository assets that leverage Terraform as a technology are detected by Snyk Essentials.
When setting up a notification action (email or Slack) for a policy, you can include a link to the relevant assets. Each notification will list all the assets impacted by the policy. You can view the assets individually, or you can see a summary of all the assets by clicking the Click Here option in the notification. The list of assets displayed in the email notification is automatically generated.
