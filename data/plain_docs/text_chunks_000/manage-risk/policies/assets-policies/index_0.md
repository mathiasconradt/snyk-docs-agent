Overview
With Policies, you can easily automate the process of adding business context and receiving notifications. 

After a policy is created, it is run in a maximum of 3 hours after creation, then once every 3 hours. 
If your policy is set to run daily, then the policy is run 3 hours after the 24-hour period ends. You can always manually run a policy by using the Run button.

Access the Snyk Essentials policies by positioning yourself at the Group level, selecting Policies, then Assets.
The following video presents an overview of the types of policies you can create from the Policies view.
