To apply a policy to an Organization, in the Organization selector panel, check the box for the Organization to which you want to apply the policy.
If an Organization has another policy applied, you can see that policy from the selector, and the policy indicator next to the Organization name will be gray.

Gray indicator - Organization has another policy applied

If the Organization already has the policy applied, the name of the policy is displayed in a yellow indicator next to the Organization name.

Yellow indicator - Organization already assigned to this policy

If you are applying a different policy to an Organization, in order to move that Organization from one policy to another, two indicators appear next to the Organization name in the selector. One shows, in yellow, the policy that is currently applied. The other shows the policy you will be applying to the Organization in gray.
