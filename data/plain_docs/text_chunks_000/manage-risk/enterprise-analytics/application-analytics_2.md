You can customize your data by using the available filters, dimension views, and specific timeframes. 
Filters are applied at the tenant level, and after being customized, they have an impact on all the reports and statistics presented on the Application Analytics page.
You can refine the data even more by using the View by options. This focuses the data on specific dimensions: Asset Class, Application, or Owner.
