Managing an AppSec program can be challenging, especially ensuring complete visibility of assets and issues. Identifying assets that require protection and monitoring them with all applicable ASTs can be difficult. This task becomes more complex with new assets and misconfigurations in ASTs, leading to incomplete coverage and critical visibility.\
\
AppSec teams must maintain a comprehensive understanding of risks and vulnerabilities linked to applications and their respective owners.
Viewing metrics for an application or owner is much more meaningful and helps to:

Clearly communicate the status and developing trends to all levels and groups across the enterprise.
Identify who should be aware of the situation and who should take action.
Make comparisons and conclude where more attention is needed.

Application analytics provides you with new levels of visibility over your important assets, applications, and code owners (teams) and helps you to identify and take action on risk and coverage.
Collaboration across Research and Development teams is necessary for achieving optimal visibility and requires attention from the AppSec team.
You can display the analytics view by:

Asset Class
Application 
Owner

By selecting a View by dimension, all exposed widgets will be affected, enabling you to compare data points based on the selected dimension.

The widgets display the top five applications or code owners based on the context. For instance, in the "open issues by control" widget, the top five applications or owners are chosen based on the total number of issues after applying the display views.\
You can also compare specific applications or owners by adding the application or owner display views.

Assets and applications vary in importance and sensitivity. Some repositories are internal and used for testing only, while others are public-facing and used in key services.
The dashboard default view compares assets and issues metrics by asset class. Display the view by dimension to see a comparison between applications or code owners throughout the dashboard.
