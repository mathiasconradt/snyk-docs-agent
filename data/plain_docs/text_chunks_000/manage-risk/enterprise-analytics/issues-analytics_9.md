Non-preventable issues are the result of an external factor, such as a new vulnerability being published or a new security rule being created, in contrast to developers not shifting left.
There may be a repository that has not been modified in months or years, but because of a newly published vulnerability, such as log4j, the asset is now vulnerable. With newly published critical or high-severity open-source vulnerabilities, there may be attention from senior leadership, partners, and customers, requiring the ability to identify issues in this category and measure their trends quickly.
Issues are categorized as Non-preventable if the issue is detected within seven days of becoming known to Snyk. This could include a new vulnerability in a dependency already in use or a vulnerability disclosed in the same time frame as the dependency was introduced to the Project. While it is possible that introducing an issue could have been prevented within the seven-day period, this definition provides some buffer for scenarios where code takes longer to get through the deployment process or for weekly recurring tests.
