The metadata completeness section provides information on the completeness of metadata from application context sources for your repositories.

Repo metadata completeness - displays the availability of application context metadata across code repositories (learn more about application context metadata here).
Repository source distribution - provides information about the repositories distributed by the type of integration (SCM integrations, third-party integrations). When viewing by application or owner, only the top 5 applications/owners with the most assets will be displayed.

The following video presents an overview of the Application Analytics Repository metadata completeness and source distribution view from the Snyk Web UI.
