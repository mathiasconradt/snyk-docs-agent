Application Analytics enables you to review and explore your AppSec program status and results from a top-down approach. You can start the exploration from a high, general level over applications, teams (owners), or asset classes and then narrow it down to the asset level.\
You can enhance the security of your application by identifying areas for improvement, recognizing developing risks, and addressing blind spots. The Application Analytics retrieves the data from all the Groups available for the tenant.

If you are using Snyk Essentials, navigate to the asset dashboard page to learn more about your assets or remain on the  Analytics page to explore the detected issues.

Harnessing Application Analytics provides answers to questions such as:

Which sensitive assets are being publicly exposed and not tested according to the coverage policy?
Which applications and code owners bear the most risk in terms of accumulated critical and high issues, and how do they compare to others?
How many repositories exist without a clear association to an application or a code owner? And are new assets being associated as expected?
