You can filter the data from your Application Analytics dashboard based on application or code owner. To proceed, it is necessary to have the appropriate metadata available for the repositories. The metadata can be pulled directly from the Snyk SCM integration. You can find details of how to set this up on the Backstage catalog in Asset Inventory page. \
To determine if this metadata is available in your repositories, check the completeness widget for repository metadata. Snyk recommends verifying that all class A assets are properly configured by using the asset class filter from the dashboard.
