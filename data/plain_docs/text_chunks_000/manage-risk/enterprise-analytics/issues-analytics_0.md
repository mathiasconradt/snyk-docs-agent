Release status
Issues Analytics is only available for customers under Enterprise plans. 

Issues Analytics takes an opinionated approach, focusing teams on a relatively recent view of the most important metrics available for critical and high-severity issues in a 90-day lookback period. These static filters are displayed at the top of the page.
The Issues Analytics are focused on metrics for the following products:

Snyk Open Source
Snyk Code
Snyk Container
Snyk IaC

You can select the Groups and Organizations that will be included in the analysis.
Metrics are organized within the pillars of the AppSec performance framework. It is critical to understand both the current state of metrics and the trend to identify anomalies or patterns that contradict expectations.
Issues Analytics is designed to make a top-level metric and its associated trend for each pillar visible at all times to support a quick understanding of the state of the program. You can navigate to a more granular view of each tab as needed. Different pillars and metrics on these views may be more or less relevant at different times to different companies, business units, products, teams, and any other participants. 
Use the tooltips throughout the pages of the Issues Analytics application for explanations of metrics and terms.
You can filter Issues Analytics on Groups or Organizations manually, as needed.

Data is refreshed in Issues Analytics daily, approximately between 13:00 and 14:00 UTC.
