This includes issues identified during the first day a Project began to be monitored. Baseline issues represent new visibility into the risk that existed when Snyk monitoring began.
Baseline issues can be identified when a company begins using a security tool, but can also be found over time. Baseline issues may be identified during the onboarding of a new business unit to Snyk, during the identification of legacy code from a previously onboarded team, or as the result of an acquisition.
While you should treat baseline issues in the same way as other issues from an exposure standpoint, an increase in baseline issues should not raise the same level of alarm as a spike in non-baseline issues.

Any issues identified in a Project after the first day of monitoring are considered non-baseline and fall into one of the following categories.
