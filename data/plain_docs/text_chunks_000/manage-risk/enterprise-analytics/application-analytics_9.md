One of the leading missions of an AppSec team is ensuring appropriate scan coverage across the asset inventory. A covered asset is simply an asset that has been scanned by a certain application security testing (AST) product. Having uncovered assets expose the company to unknown risks, that is why it is essential to verify that business critical assets (based on asset class or strategic applications), are being properly scanned.
In the Coverage section, you have information about the assets coverage. 

Coverage overview - provides information, in percentages, about the scanned assets, distributed by the scan category (SAST, SCA, Container, and Secrets).
Coverage trend - allows reviewing the coverage trend for the last 3 months. A growing trend will indicate that a larger portion of your asset inventory was scanned.

The Coverage section is based on the scan category and is not impacted by the selected view ( Asset Class, Application, or Owner).
