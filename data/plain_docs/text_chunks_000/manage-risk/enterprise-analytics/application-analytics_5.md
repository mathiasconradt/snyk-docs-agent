Asset class reflects the business criticality of the asset from A (most critical) to D (least critical).\
By having this level of visibility, you can prioritize the most crucial assets in your inventory, applications, or code owners.\
To associate assets with asset class, you can either change the asset class manually in the inventory screen or preferably define a classification policy that will automatically assign an asset class to your assets.
