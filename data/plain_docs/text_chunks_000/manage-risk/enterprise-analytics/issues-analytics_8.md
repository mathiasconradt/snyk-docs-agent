Preventable issues could have been identified and remediated earlier in the SDLC if developers had taken greater advantage of available shift-left tooling and processes.
Issues can be prevented by developers taking advantage of Snyk Learn, leveraging the IDE plug-ins, activating PR checks, running snyk test locally in the CLI, breaking the build, or taking any other available actions for catching issues pre-production. If Snyk knows about an issue, a test can catch it. You can stop preventable issues from getting into production environments by increasing the threshold for what breaks a build. You can increase the threshold from only critical issues, to critical and high issues, or strictly refrain from approving PRs that fail a Snyk test.
Issues are categorized as Preventable if the problem was known to Snyk at least seven days before the detection of the issue. While it is possible that introducing an issue could have been prevented within the seven-day interval, this definition provides some buffer for scenarios where code takes longer to get through the deployment process or for weekly recurring tests.

The following example is also a preventable issue.
A developer adds a vulnerable version of a package as part of development. Despite a strong shift-left culture where running the snyk test command found this known issue, there was no fix available. The developer opted to use the vulnerable library instead of selecting an alternative because the issue had been known for a long time, or the developer felt the exploit was not relevant to how the package was being used, or both.
