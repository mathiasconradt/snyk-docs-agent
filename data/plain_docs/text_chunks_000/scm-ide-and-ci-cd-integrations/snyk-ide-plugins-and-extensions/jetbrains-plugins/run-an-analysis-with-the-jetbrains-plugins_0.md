Ensure the Snyk extension is configured, authenticated, and trusted for your current Project, as described in the configuration and authentication pages.

You can trigger snyk test using one of these methods:

automatic (default)
manual

A Snyk scan is triggered automatically when your Project is opened and when any supported files are saved. This behavior can be turned off using the existing configuration.

Ensure your files are saved before manually running an analysis.

To manually trigger snyk test (see the screen image that follows):

Click the Snyk icon in the sidebar to open the Snyk panel.
Click the Run (play) button at the top of the plugin sidebar.
