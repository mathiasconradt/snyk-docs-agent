Scan early, fix as you develop: elevate your security posture
Integrating security checks early in your development lifecycle helps you pass security reviews seamlessly and avoid expensive fixes down the line.
The Snyk Eclipse extension allows you to analyze your code, open-source dependencies, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations. With actionable insights directly in your IDE, you can address issues as they arise.
Key features:

In-line issue highlighting: Security issues are flagged directly within your code, categorized by type and severity for quick identification and resolution.
Comprehensive scanning: The extension scans for a wide range of security issues, including:
Open Source Security: Detects vulnerabilities and license issues in both direct and transitive open-source dependencies. Automated fix suggestions simplify remediation. Explore more in the Snyk Open Source documentation.
Code Security: Identifies security vulnerabilities in your custom code. Explore more in the Snyk Code documentation.
IaC Security: Uncovers configuration issues in your Infrastructure as Code templates (Terraform, Kubernetes, CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager). Explore more in the IaC documentation.
Broad language and framework support: Snyk Open Source and Snyk Code cover a wide array of package managers, programming languages, and frameworks, with ongoing updates to support the latest technologies. For the most up-to-date information on supported languages, package managers, and frameworks, see the supported language technologies pages.
