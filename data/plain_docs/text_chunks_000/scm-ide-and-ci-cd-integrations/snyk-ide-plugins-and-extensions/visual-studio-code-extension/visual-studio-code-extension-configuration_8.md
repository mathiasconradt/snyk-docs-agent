If you are behind a proxy, configure the proxy settings using VS Code proxy settings Application > Proxy or set the proxy settings using the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables.
For example, the commonly used setting Proxy Strict SSL specifies that the proxy server certificate should be verified against the list of supplied CAs specific to Snyk Code.
