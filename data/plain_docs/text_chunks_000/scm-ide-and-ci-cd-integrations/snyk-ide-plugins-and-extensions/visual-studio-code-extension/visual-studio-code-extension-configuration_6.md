When Automatic Dependency Management is checked, the plugin will download the Language Server and the CLI and update them regularly to the defined CLI path and Language Server path if defined. Uncheck this option if downloading the CLI is not possible due to your network configuration, for example, due to firewall rules, and you need to obtain these dependencies through other means.
CLI Path: Allow changing a file path of the CLI (optional field).
Language Server Path: Allow changing a file path of the Language Server (optional field).
