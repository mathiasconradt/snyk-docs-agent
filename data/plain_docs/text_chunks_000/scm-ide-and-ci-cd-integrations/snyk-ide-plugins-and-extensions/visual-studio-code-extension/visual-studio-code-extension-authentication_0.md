To scan your Projects you must authenticate with Snyk. 

Before authenticating, be sure you have set your region properly. For details, see Regional hosting and data residency, which has the list of regional URLs.

Snyk supports the following protocols for authentication:

OAuth 2.0 (default)
Snyk API token (fallback option)

For both methods, Snyk uses the Secret Storage API to store the token securely. This storage uses the system's keychain to manage the token.
