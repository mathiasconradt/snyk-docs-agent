Snuk Code vulnerability window
The Snyk suggestion panel on the right of the results screen shows the Snyk Code Vulnerability name, the line it was found in, a suggestion for a fix ,and an option to ignore (either in the entire file or a specific line).
Snyk also includes a feedback mechanism to report false positives so others do not see the same issue (bottom left).
