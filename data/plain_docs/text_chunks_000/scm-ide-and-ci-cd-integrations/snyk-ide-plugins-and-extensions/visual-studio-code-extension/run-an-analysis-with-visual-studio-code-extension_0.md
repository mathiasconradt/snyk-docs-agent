Ensure the Snyk extension is configured, authenticated, and trusted for your current project, as described in the authentication and configuration pages.

You can trigger snyk test using one of these methods:

automatic (default)
manual

Snyk Code and Iac (configuration) scans are triggered automatically when your Project is opened and when any supported files are saved. This behavior can be turned off using an existing configuration.
Snyk Open Source does not automatically run on save by default, but you can enable auto-scan in settings.

Ensure your files are saved before manually running an analysis.

To manually trigger snyk test (see the screen image that follows):

Click the Snyk icon in the sidebar to open the Snyk panel.
Click the Rescan (play) button at the top of the plugin panel.
