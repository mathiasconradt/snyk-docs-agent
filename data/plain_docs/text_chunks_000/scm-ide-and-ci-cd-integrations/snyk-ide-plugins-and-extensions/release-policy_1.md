All Snyk IDE plugins follow industry standard Semantic Versioning, which has a three-part notation. Given a version number, MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make breaking changes; examples follow.
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
PATCH version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

Release notes identify all changes, focusing on new features or significant changes.
Examples of breaking changes include the following:

Deprecating features that produced findings before, which means users will get fewer findings after the release.
Introducing new features that might introduce new findings.
Introducing mandatory configuration changes that might affect the number of findings.
