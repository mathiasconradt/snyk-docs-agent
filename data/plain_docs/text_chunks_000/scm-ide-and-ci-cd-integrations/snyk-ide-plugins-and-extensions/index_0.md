Snyk Security plugins and extensions find and fix security vulnerabilities and issues in Snyk Projects. This allows individual developers, open source contributors, and code maintainers to pass security reviews, avoid costly fixes later in development, and reduce time to develop and deliver secure code.
The results of a vulnerability scan show issues with context, impact, and fix guidance in your IDE, where the fix for the vulnerability can be done right in the IDE itself.
The Snyk IDE plugins and extensions rely on the Snyk CLI to perform many functions. For details, refer to the documentation for each IDE.  When you are troubleshooting, it is always helpful to run the CLI for the same action with the debug option, -d.
The Snyk IDE plugins and extensions also rely on the Snyk Vulnerability Database. For more information, see the documentation for the Snyk Vulnerability Database.
If Snyk is hosting your data in a region other than the default, you must set the Custom endpoint in the IDE. For more information, see IDEs URLS on the Regional hosting and data residency page.
