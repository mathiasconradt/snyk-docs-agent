Snyk supports the latest version for VS 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2022, as long as the user is on the latest minor and revision version. A simple upgrade can ensure that.
If a user has a bug with the Snyk plugin (especially bugs where the plugin fails to load and there are contains errors about missing files/DLLs), or both, the bug can be resolved by upgrading VS most of the time.
