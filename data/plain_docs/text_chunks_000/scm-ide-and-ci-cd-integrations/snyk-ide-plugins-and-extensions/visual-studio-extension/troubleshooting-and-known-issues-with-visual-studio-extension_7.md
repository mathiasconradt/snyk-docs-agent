When customers mention that they are using a VS version, they usually say something like “we’re using VS 2022” or “VS 2019”. The year indicates the major part of the version. The “real” version is as follows:
| 2022 | 17.* |
| ---- | ----- |
| 2019 | 16.* |
| 2017 | 15.* |
| 2015 | 14.* |
The other two parts of the version are the minor and the revision parts.
For example, your current may be VS 2022 version is 17.2.6, so the minor is 2 and the revision is 6.
