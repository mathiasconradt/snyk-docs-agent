Note that your solution must be built successfully in order to allow the CLI to pick up the dependencies and find the vulnerabilities.
If you see only npm vulnerabilities or vulnerabilities that are not related to your C#/.NET Projects, that can mean your Project was not built successfully and was not detected by the CLI. If you have difficulty or questions, submit a request to Snyk Support.
