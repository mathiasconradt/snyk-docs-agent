To find the automatically managed Snyk CLI, the XDG Data Home and PATH path are automatically scanned for the OS-dependent file, for example, snyk-macos on macOS, snyk-linux on Linux and snyk-win.exe on Windows, and the first path where it is found is added to the environment. It is later used for all functionality that depends on the CLI. The path to the CLI can also be set manually using the cliPath initialization option.
