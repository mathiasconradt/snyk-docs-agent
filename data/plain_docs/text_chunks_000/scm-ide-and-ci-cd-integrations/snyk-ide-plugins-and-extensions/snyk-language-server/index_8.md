When Snyk Language Server starts, it checks for a token in the initializationOption token. If a token is not there, Snyk Language Server tries to retrieve and authenticate using the Snyk CLI. If the CLI is not authenticated either, Snyk Language Server opens a browser window to authenticate. After successful authentication in the web browser, Snyk Language Server automatically retrieves the Snyk authentication token from the CLI.
