As an Enterprise plan user, Snyk recommends using the GitHub Enterprise integration as it enables you to use a single GitHub service account personal access token (PAT) across your Snyk Organization rather than depending on a PAT for an individual user account. You can use this integration whether or not you have a GitHub Enterprise (GHE) license or subscription.
Another benefit to using the GitHub Enterprise integration is that you can choose to clone integration settings when you are creating new Snyk Organizations. This means you can use one GitHub Enterprise integration for all Organizations in your Snyk Group.
As a Free or Team plan user, Snyk recommends using the GitHub integration as it only requires a PAT for an individual user account, which should meet your needs at this level.
If you use the self-hosted GitHub Enterprise product, you must use the GitHub Enterprise integration.
