In the new app integration, every Snyk Organization can connect to only one workspace in Bitbucket Cloud. If you want to import Projects from various workspaces in Bitbucket into the same single Organization in Snyk, use the PAT integration.
The new app integration does not yet support Snyk Multi-Tenant EU, Snyk Multi-Tenant AUS, and Snyk Single-Tenant cloud deployments.
For customers who are part of the custom branch closed beta, the new app integration's first-party interface in Bitbucket Cloud does not allow importing Projects from non-default branches. It is possible to import a non-default branch; you must do it from the Snyk.io import modal.
