No, the Personal Access Token Bitbucket Cloud integration is fully supported, and there are no plans to stop supporting it.
However, there is a first-party interface extension app that serves as an extension layer to the PAT integration, allowing developers to consume Snyk's findings from within the Bitbucket interface. This extension app was developed and supported by an external contractor company. As this functionality is now an integral part of the new app integration, the extension app has now moved to no-support mode, meaning that customers who use the PAT integration alongside the first-party extension app must migrate to the new app integration to get support for the first-party interface functionality.
