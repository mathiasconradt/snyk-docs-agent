Disconnecting the Snyk GitHub Enterprise integration halts all scans for imported repositories, PR checks cannot be executed, and Projects are deactivated in the Snyk Web UI.


Navigate to the Snyk GitHub Enterprise integration Settings.
At the bottom of the page, select Remove GitHub Enterprise.

A confirmation modal opens. To proceed, select Disconnect GitHub Enterprise. \
Confirm disconnecting from GitHub Enterprise


After GitHub Enterprise is disconnected, imported Snyk Projects will be set to inactive, and you will no longer get alerts, pull requests, or Snyk tests on pull requests.
You can re-connect anytime; however, re-initiating GitHub Enterprise projects for monitoring requires setting up the integration again.
