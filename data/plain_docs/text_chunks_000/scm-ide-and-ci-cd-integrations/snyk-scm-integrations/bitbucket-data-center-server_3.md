To select the repositories for Snyk to monitor:

Click Add your Bitbucket Server repositories to Snyk to start importing repositories to Snyk.
When prompted, select the repositories to import to Snyk and click Add selected repositories.

After they are added, Snyk scans the selected repositories for dependency files in the entire directory tree, (that is, package.json, pom.xml, and so on) and imports them to Snyk as projects.\
\
The imported Projects appear on your Snyk Projects page and are continuously checked for vulnerabilities.
