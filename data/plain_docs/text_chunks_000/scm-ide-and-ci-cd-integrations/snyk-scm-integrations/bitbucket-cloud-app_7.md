Snyk tests any newly created pull request in your repositories for security vulnerabilities and sends a build check to Bitbucket Cloud. You can see directly from Bitbucket Cloud whether or not the pull request introduces new security issues.
The example that follows shows a Snyk pull request build check on the Bitbucket Cloud Pull Request page.

Scroll to Default Snyk test for pull requests > Open Source Security & Licenses, and configure the relevant options. See Configure PR Checks for more details.
