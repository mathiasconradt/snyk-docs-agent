Usually, migrating from Bitbucket Server to Bitbucket Data Center requires no further action. The Snyk integration should keep working as Bitbucket Server and Bitbucket Data Center APIs are identical.
Action is required only when the new Bitbucket Data Center instance URL differs from the Bitbucket Server instance URL. In this case, you must reconnect the integration from the Bitbucket Server-Bitbucket Data Center integration page in Snyk.io. To reconnect, follow the steps in How to set up a Bitbucket DC/Server Integration.
