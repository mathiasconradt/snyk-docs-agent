In the policy builder you can find only the attributes you have previously selected when configuring the backstage catalog file. 
The following list describes all possible backstage attributes that you can choose from when you configure the backstage catalog file. 

Application - represents a group of components that serve the same purpose. 
Owner - specifies the team owning the repository.
Catalog name - the metadata name.
Title - a name to display for the entity instead of the property. It is an alternative to the metadata name, when the catalog name is too hard to read.
