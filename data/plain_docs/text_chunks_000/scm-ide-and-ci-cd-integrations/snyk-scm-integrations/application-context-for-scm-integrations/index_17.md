Open the Integration Hub menu. 
Select the App Context tag and search for Datadog Service Catalog. 
Click the Add button.
Add the Profile name - this is the name of your Datadog instance.
Add the API key for your Datadog instance.
Add the Application key for your Datadog instance.
Add the details of your Datadog site.
You can select one or more attributes related to repository assets that Snyk Essentials can pull from Datadog Service Catalog with the following mapping:
Catalog name - If you select this metadata, it is mandatory to add the Catalog name key.
Title - If you select this metadata, it is mandatory to add the Title key.
Category - If you select this metadata, it is mandatory to add the Category key.
Lifecycle - If you select this metadata, it is mandatory to add the Lifecycle key.
Owner - If you select this metadata, it is mandatory to add the Owner key.
Application - If you select this metadata, it is mandatory to add the Application key.
Click the Done button.
When the connection is established, the status of the Datadog Service Catalog integration is changed to Connected, and Snyk Essentials will start enriching repository assets collected by a Snyk Essentials SCM Integration with the data found in Datadog Service Catalog.


When you set up the catalog attributes, you can customize the name of the attribute but must ensure that the same name is used in the catalog and in the Integration Hub setup.
