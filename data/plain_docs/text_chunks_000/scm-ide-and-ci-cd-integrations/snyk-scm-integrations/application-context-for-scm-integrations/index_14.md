You can select one or more attributes related to repository assets that Snyk Essentials can pull from OpsLevel with the following mapping:
Catalog name - Identified with name in OpsLevel.
Category - Identified with tier.name in OpsLevel.
Lifecycle - Identified with lifecycle.name in OpsLevel.
Owner - Identified with owner.name in OpsLevel.
Application - Identified with product in OpsLevel.
Click the Done button.
When the connection is established, the status of the OpsLevel integration is changed to Connected, and Snyk Essentials will start enriching repository assets with the data found in OpsLevel.


When you set up the catalog attributes, you must use the specific service-level attributes, for example attribute.name.
