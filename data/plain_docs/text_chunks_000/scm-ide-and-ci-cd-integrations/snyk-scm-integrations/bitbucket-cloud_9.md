When you disconnect Snyk from your repository Projects, your credentials are removed from Snyk, and any integration-specific Projects that Snyk is monitoring are deactivated in Snyk.\
If you choose to re-enable this integration, you must re-enter your credentials and activate your Projects.

To disconnect this integration, in Organization settings > Integrations:

In your list of integrations, select the Bitbucket integration you want to deactivate and click Edit settings to open a page with the current status of your integration.\
   \
   The page includes sections that are specific to each integration, where you can manage your credentials, API key, Service Principal, or connection details.
Scroll to the relevant section and click Disconnect.
