An administrator can manage Snyk PR Checks settings for each SCM integration at the Organization level and then apply these settings, either to all the Projects for that integration or to selected specific Projects. You can configure whether this feature is on (enabled by default) and set fail conditions to define when Snyk should fail your PR checks.
See Configure PR Checks at the Integration level and Configure PR Checks at the Project level for details of this process. 

Use Snyk License policies to ensure that your Snyk PRs are free of licensing issues.\
See Licenses for more information.
