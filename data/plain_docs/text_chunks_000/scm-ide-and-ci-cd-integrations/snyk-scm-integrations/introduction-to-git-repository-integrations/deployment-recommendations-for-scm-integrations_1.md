| Stage 2:Import all of the relevant projects from your integrated SCM.                                                                                             | • Test both public and private repos• Disable all user notifications• Disable Snyk PR status checks• Disable Automatic fix pull requests• Disable Automatic dependency upgrade pull requests• Disable Update Dockerfile base images                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Snyk will scan your imported repositories to detect all supported files and create them as Projects where you can view the vulnerabilities detected.Disabling these features removes potential blockers for your initial setup and use of Snyk. This way, you have scheduled scans and high visibility of reporting without blocking deployments. |
| Stage 3:Build a fix plan using Snyk prioritization reporting capabilities.                                                                                | Learn more about Snyk Priority Score and Snyk Risk Score to understand how you can leverage these features to help prioritize which issues to fix.                                                                                                                                                                                             | Alignment between Developers and Security on what should be fixed and when to streamline the fix process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Stage 4:Configure Snyk PR Checks and auto-fix PRs to alert developers to issues in real-time, with available fixes.                                           | Enable Snyk PR status checks so developers know whether their PR contains high-severity issues with available fixes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Make it easy for your developers to see new issues before they are merged into the repository, decreasing the number of new vulnerabilities added and enabling them to make decisions on blocking a merge.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Stage 5:Prevent developers from introducing any new vulnerabilities.                                                                                            | Enable branch protection in your SCM tool so that PRs with failing Snyk PR status checks cannot be merged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | This change will prevent PRs from being merged into your repository if Snyk detects new vulnerabilities. Over time, you can adjust the sensitivity of the check to include all high or critical severity issues, regardless of whether a fix is available.                                                                                                       |

Keeping your dependencies up to date helps to reduce future design headaches and hot fixes, which can be time consuming to research and address.                                                                                                                                      |
