Traditionally, Snyk has accessed repository contents using SCM APIs, which impose primary and secondary rate limits, and content limits. For example, the GitHub.com APIs are rate-limited to allow only a certain number of requests per hour, and there is a limit on the number of tree entries that can be retrieved from the Git database.
When repository contents are retrieved over these APIs, these limitations inhibit Snyk’s providing a complete analysis in a number of ways, especially across a very large number of repositories, or for repositories containing more than 100,000 files, sometimes referred to as monorepos.
Through Workspaces, these limitations are removed.
