By default, Snyk emails every Org user when a new issue or fix in a Project’s dependencies is found, and provides each user with a weekly update of the security status across the Organization. If you plan to import many Projects to an Organization, to avoid sending multiple email notifications sent to users, consider disabling all the notifications for that Organization.
To customize the emails your Org users receive, go to Settings > Notifications > Notification Setting. The changes you make here will affect all of your Organization’s members, although Org users can override these default settings in their user-level account settings.
To disable notifications for all the users in an Org ahead of your import, deselect the appropriate notification boxes. See Manage notifications for more details.
