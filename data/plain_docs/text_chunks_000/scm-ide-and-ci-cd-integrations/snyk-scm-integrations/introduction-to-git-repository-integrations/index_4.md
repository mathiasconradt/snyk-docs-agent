Snyk can again act as a “gate” when you are building the application, checking that the code is secure at this stage by checking for issues automatically as part of the build process. This prevents a build from being completed based on policies as needed.
You can choose to report on issues, allowing the build to happen, or to stop the build if issues are encountered. You can also easily add criteria to this process, including exploitability, CVSS score, and whether a fix exists, thus focusing on fixing the issues that matter to you.
Snyk provides a number of Snyk tools to help with this process.
