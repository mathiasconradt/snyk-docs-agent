After you have embedded Snyk into your software development life cycle (SDLC), and have built good developer awareness, you can start to apply stricter policies to improve your overall security posture, for example:

Low priority Projects: you can fail the PR only for new high-severity issues that are fixable.
Medium priority Projects: fail the PR only for high-severity issues.
High priority Projects (PCI/GDPR compliance): fail the PR for any issue.


To align vulnerability severity with your internal policy, use security policies to change the severity of issues and attach them to relevant Project attributes. See Security policies for more details.
