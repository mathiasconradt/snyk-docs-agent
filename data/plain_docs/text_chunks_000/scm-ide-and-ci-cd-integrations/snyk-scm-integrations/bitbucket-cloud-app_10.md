When you disconnect Snyk from your repository Projects, your credentials are removed from Snyk, and any integration-specific Projects that Snyk is monitoring are deactivated in Snyk.
If you choose to re-enable this integration later, you must re-enter your credentials and activate your Projects.

To disable this integration, in Organization settings > Integrations > Source Control > Bitbucket Cloud App:

In your list of integrations, select the Bitbucket Cloud App integration you want to deactivate and click Edit settings to open a page with the current status of your integration.\
   \
   The page includes sections that are specific to each integration, where you can manage your credentials, API key, Service Principal, or connection details.
Scroll to the Disconnect section and click Remove to remove the integration.


Disconnecting the integration from the Snyk side does not uninstall the app from your workspace in Bitbucket Cloud. To uninstall the Bitbucket app, navigate to your workspace settings in Bitbucket.org --> Installed Apps and remove the Snyk Security for Bitbucket Cloud app.
