The Snyk Bitbucket integrations use different access control mechanisms to connect with Snyk:

Snyk Bitbucket Cloud requires the creation of an app password.
Snyk Bitbucket Cloud App requires Bitbucket workspace authorization and related permissions.
Snyk Bitbucket Data Center/Server requires a dedicated username and password or a personal access token (PAT).


To set up any Snyk Bitbucket integration, you must be a Bitbucket Workspace Admin.
