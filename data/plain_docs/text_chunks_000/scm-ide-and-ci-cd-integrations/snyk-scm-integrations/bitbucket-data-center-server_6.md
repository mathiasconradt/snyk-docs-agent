Snyk scans your Projects on either a daily or a weekly basis. When new vulnerabilities are found, Snyk notifies you by email and by opening automated Snyk pull requests with fixes for your repositories.
The example that follows shows a fix pull request opened by Snyk.

Snyk pull requests are automatically assigned to the default reviewer set in your Bitbucket Server/Data Center account.
Unlike manual pull requests opened from the Bitbucket interface, for the Snyk Bitbucket Cloud integration, Snyk pull requests are not automatically assigned to the default reviewer set in your Bitbucket Cloud account.
For more information, see Automated pull request creation for new fixes.
