When you want to add new integrations to your  Snyk account you need to first decide the level type at which you want to install the integration.

Group level - Add integrations to your Snyk application that will be available for your Snyk Essentials. If you want to set up integrations for Snyk Essentials, use the Integrations menu at the Group level.
Organization level - Add integrations for your Snyk application that will be available for all Snyk products, except Snyk Essentials or Snyk AppRisk.

Snyk offers GitHub Read-only Projects, providing the ability to monitor a public GitHub repository that is not owned by your Organization.
