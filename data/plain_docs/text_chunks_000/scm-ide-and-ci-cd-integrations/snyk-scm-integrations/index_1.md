When you want to add new integrations to your Snyk account you must first decide the level type at which you want to install the integration. Snyk supports different SCM integrations on different levels of the Snyk hierarchy:

Group level - Group level integrations only support Snyk Essentials or Snyk AppRisk.
Organization level - Organization level integrations support all other Snyk products. Snyk does not support Snyk Essentials or Snyk AppRisk integrations at the Organization level.


If you added the GitHub integration at Organizational and/or Group levels and you have configured SAML SSO for it, then you must authorize your GitHub PAT. Navigate to the How to authorize your Personal Access Token and enable SSO page for more details.
