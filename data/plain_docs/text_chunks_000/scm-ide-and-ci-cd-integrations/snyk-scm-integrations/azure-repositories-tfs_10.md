After repositories are imported, a confirmation appears in green at the top of the screen. The selected files are marked with a unique icon and named by Organization and repository. You can filter to view only those Projects by selecting the Azure Repos filter option.

The Azure Repository integration works like the other Snyk SCM integrations. To continue to monitor, fix, and manage your Projects, see the Projects documentation.
