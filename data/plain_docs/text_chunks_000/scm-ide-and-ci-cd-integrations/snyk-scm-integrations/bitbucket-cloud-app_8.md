When you install the Snyk Bitbucket Cloud App integration in your Bitbucket workspace, the members of your workspace can import repositories and see the security issues related to their repositories in a dedicated Snyk security tab in Bitbucket Cloud.
Snyk Security tab in Bitbucket Cloud

The first-party interface currently supports only the Snyk Open Source and Snyk Container products. Issues from other Snyk products do not show up on this page.

You can associate a first-party interface with a different Snyk account or Organization.
During the first-time Bitbucket Cloud App onboarding process, the first-party interface is associated with a specific Snyk Organization. This is the Snyk Organization to which Bitbucket users will import repositories and for which they will view Snyk issues.
To change the Snyk Organization after onboarding, go to the workspace settings > Security for Bitbucket Cloud > Integration Settings and click Connect via a different Snyk user/organization.
Create integration settings for a different Organization
The installation process begins again, and you can choose the relevant Snyk Organization.
