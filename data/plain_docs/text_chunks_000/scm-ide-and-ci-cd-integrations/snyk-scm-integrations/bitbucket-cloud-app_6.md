Snyk produces advanced security reports that let you explore the vulnerabilities found in your repositories, and fix them immediately by opening a fix pull request directly to your repository, with the required upgrades or patches.
The example that follows shows a Project-level security report.
Project-level security report
Snyk scans your Projects on either a daily or a weekly basis. When new vulnerabilities are found, Snyk notifies you by email and by opening automated pull requests with fixes for your repositories.

Unlike manual pull requests opened from the Bitbucket interface, Snyk pull requests are not automatically assigned to the default reviewer set in your Bitbucket Cloud account.
For more information, see Automated pull request creation for new fixes.
