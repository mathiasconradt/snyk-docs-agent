An integrated SCM token is required for Broker client setup. It is used in the -e <SCM>_TOKEN parameter, for example, -e GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx…, to enable access to the SCM. These meet certain permissions needed for the operation of Broker and Snyk Code.
An integrated SCM token can be generated for the following SCM integrations:

GitHub and GitHub Enterprise
GitLab
Azure Repositories (TFS)
Bitbucket Server/Data Center
