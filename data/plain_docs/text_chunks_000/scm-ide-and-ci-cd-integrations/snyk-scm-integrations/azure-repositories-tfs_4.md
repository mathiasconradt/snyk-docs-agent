The process to connect Snyk with your Azure repositories includes the following steps:

Generate a unique Azure DevOps personal access token (PAT) for Snyk, based on a username and password combination, and configured with the specific permissions Snyk needs to access your Azure repositories. For more information, see Configure a Personal Access Token (PAT).
Enable the integration through the Snyk Web UI.
Select the Projects and repositories you want to associate with Snyk for testing and monitoring.\
   You can also enter custom file locations for any manifest files that are not located in the root folders of your repositories.
