Add a GitLab Personal Access Token in GitLab

Generate a GitLab Personal Access Token in a GitLab instance.\
   Select the profile icon, then Edit Profile > Access Tokens.\
   Set the token name, for example, Snyk, and select the api scope. The api scope grants complete read/write access to the API, including all groups and projects, the container registry, and the package registry.
Navigate to the Snyk Integrations page, select the GitLab integration tile, and enter the URL of the GitLab instance and the token you generated.
Click Save.
When the tile on the Integrations page indicates the integration is Configured, click the tile and select the GitLab projects to test or select Add projects from the Snyk Dashboard.
