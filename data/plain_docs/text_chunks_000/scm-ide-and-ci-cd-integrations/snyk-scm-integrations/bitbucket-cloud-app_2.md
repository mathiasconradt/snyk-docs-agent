To give Snyk access to your Bitbucket account, you need to install the Snyk App on your Bitbucket Cloud workspace.

To install the Snyk App on your Bitbucket Cloud workspace, you must have Admin permissions for the Workspace in Bitbucket.


In Snyk, navigate to Integrations (Source control), then Bitbucket Cloud App tile, and click Connect to install the Snyk Bitbucket Cloud App on your Bitbucket Cloud workspace.

In the new Bitbucket tab, select the relevant workspace to connect to your Snyk Organization from the list and Grant access to let Snyk:

Read your account information 
Read and modify your repositories and their pull requests
Read and modify your repositories' webhooks

Allow access for Snyk to Bitbucket Cloud
3.  Grant access to your Snyk Organization when you're prompted.
Allow Bitbucket Cloud access to your Snyk Organization
After you allow access to the Snyk Organization, the Snyk Organization Settings page opens and confirms that the Bitbucket Cloud App is connected.


After Snyk is integrated with Bitbucket Cloud, you can see the new Snyk security tab on the repository page and import and explore the issues and vulnerabilities for your repository Projects directly in Bitbucket.
