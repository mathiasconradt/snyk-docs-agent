Bitbucket Server and Bitbucket Cloud do not support automatic language detection. You can manually add language tags to a Bitbucket Cloud repository.\
After manually setting up the languages in your Bitbucket project, Snyk can automatically detect and ingest all those languages in your Snyk Essentials application.
