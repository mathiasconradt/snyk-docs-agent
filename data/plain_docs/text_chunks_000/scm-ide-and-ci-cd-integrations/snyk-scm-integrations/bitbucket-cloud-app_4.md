After you connect Snyk to your Bitbucket Cloud account, you can select repositories for Snyk to monitor.

In Snyk, navigate to Integrations, then Bitbucket Cloud App card and click to start importing repositories to Snyk.
Choose the repositories you want to import to Snyk and click Add selected repositories.

After you add them, Snyk scans the selected repositories for dependency files in the entire directory tree, that is, package.json, pom.xml, and so on, and imports them to Snyk as Projects.
The imported Projects appear on your Projects page and are continuously checked for vulnerabilities.
