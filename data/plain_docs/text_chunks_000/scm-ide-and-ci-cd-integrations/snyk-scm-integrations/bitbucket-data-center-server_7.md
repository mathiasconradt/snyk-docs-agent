Snyk Code PR Checks are only available for Bitbucket DC/Server versions 7.0 and above.

Snyk tests any newly created pull request in your repositories for security vulnerabilities and sends a build check to Bitbucket DC/Server. You can see directly from Bitbucket DC/Server whether or not the pull request introduces new security issues.
The example that follows shows a Snyk pull request build check on the Bitbucket DC/Server Pull Request page.

To review and adjust the pull request tests settings:

In Snyk, navigate to Organization settings > Integrations > Source control > Bitbucket Server and click Edit Settings.
Scroll to Default Snyk test for pull requests > Open Source Security & Licenses, and configure the relevant options.
