Disconnecting the GitLab integration removes all Snyk webhooks, along with the Snyk credentials, and deactivates the GitLab Projects in the Snyk Web UI.
The Projects will be set to inactive, and you will no longer get alerts, pull requests, or Snyk tests on your pull requests.


Navigate to the Snyk GitLab integration Settings.
At the bottom of the page, select Remove GitLab.

A confirmation screen opens. To proceed, select Disconnect GitLab.\
Confirm disconnecting from GitLab


After GitLab is disconnected, Snyk Projects imported from GitLab will be set to inactive, and you will no longer get alerts, pull requests, or Snyk tests on pull requests. The webhook that enables the integration for this repository will be removed.
You can re-connect anytime; however, re-initiating GitLab projects for monitoring requires setting up the integration again.
