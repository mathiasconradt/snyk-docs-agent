The wildcard integration allows you to use a special character to detect and integrate multiple SCM organizations simultaneously. 

The wildcard integration applies to the GitHub and Azure DevOps integrations and offers support when you set them up using Snyk Broker. 

You can use the wildcards while setting up your integration using the Integration Hub:

Open the Integration Hub menu. 
Select the SCM tag and search for GitHub or Azure DevOps. 
Click the Add button.
In the Organizations field, add the Organization details by using the * symbol. For example, using  *snyk integrates all SCM Organizations that have Snyk in their name.
All the Organizations that match with the wildcard, * symbol will be added. 


The wildcard, * symbol is considered a living command and will be applied every time you are rescanning your repositories.
