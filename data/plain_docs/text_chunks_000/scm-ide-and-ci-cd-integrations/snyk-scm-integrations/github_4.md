The GitHub integration is set up for your user account, not for a Snyk Organization. GitHub integration settings apply to all Organizations associated with your user account but do not automatically apply to other user accounts in an Organization.
When you import a Snyk Project using your GitHub integration with the Snyk PR functionality enabled, Snyk PRs are created for that Project. However, if another user imports Projects with their GitHub integration after disabling the Snyk PR functionality, Snyk PRs are not created for the Projects they import.
