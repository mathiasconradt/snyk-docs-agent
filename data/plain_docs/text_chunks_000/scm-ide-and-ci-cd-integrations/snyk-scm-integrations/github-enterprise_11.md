Feature availability
The Auto-assign PRs feature is supported only for private repositories.

Snyk can automatically assign the pull requests it creates to ensure that they are handled by the right team members.
Auto-assign for PRs can be enabled for the GitHub and GitHub Enterprise integration and all Projects imported via GitHub, or on a per-Project basis.
Users can either be manually specified, and all will be assigned, or automatically selected based on the last commit user account.
