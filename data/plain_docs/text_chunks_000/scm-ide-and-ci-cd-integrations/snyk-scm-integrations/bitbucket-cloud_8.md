All the operations, whether triggered manually or automatically, are performed for a Bitbucket Cloud service account that has its token (App Password) configured in the Integration settings.
For Snyk to perform the required operations on monitored repositories, such as reading manifest files on a frequent basis and opening fix or upgrade PRs, the integrated Bitbucket Cloud service account needs Admin permissions on the imported repositories.
For detailed information on the permission scopes required, see Bitbucket permission requirements.
