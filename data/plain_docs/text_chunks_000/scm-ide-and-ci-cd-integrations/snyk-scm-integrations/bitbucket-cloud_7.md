Snyk tests any newly-created pull request in your repositories for security vulnerabilities and sends a build check to Bitbucket Cloud. You can see directly from Bitbucket Cloud whether or not the pull request introduces new security issues.
The example that follows shows a Snyk pull request build check on the Bitbucket Cloud Pull Request page.
