The Snyk PR Checks feature allows Snyk to test any new PR in your repositories for security vulnerabilities and sends a status check to GitHub. This lets you see, directly in GitHub, whether or not the pull request introduces new security issues.
This example shows how Snyk PR checks appear on the GitHub pull request page.
