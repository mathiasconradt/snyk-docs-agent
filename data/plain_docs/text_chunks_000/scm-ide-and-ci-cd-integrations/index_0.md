This section of the documentation provides information about Snyk SCM, IDE, and CI/CD integrations.
Snyk supports SCM, IDE, and CI/CD integration methods that allow you to implement security at each point in your workflow: importing a Project, writing your code, and building and deployment.

Feature availability
The API and Snyk Essentials are available only with Enterprise plans. For more information, see plans and pricing.

There are two ways of implementing SCM integrations in a Snyk environment:

Group level - At the Group level, you can set up the SCM integrations for Snyk Essentials. 
Organization level - At the Organization level, you can set up the SCM integrations for all other Snyk products and all Snyk plans. See the Manage your Integrations at the Organizational level page for more details. 


If you want to use the same SCM integration at both Group and Organization levels, then you must set up that integration for both levels.
