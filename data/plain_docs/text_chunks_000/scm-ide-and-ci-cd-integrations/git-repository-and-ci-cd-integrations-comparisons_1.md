Use Git repository integrations to Improve the security of your code and deployed applications.
Git repository integration allows scanning and visibility early in the software development lifecycle through:

Automatic daily rescanning of all imported Projects
Checking all submitted PRs for security issues
Generating dependency upgrade PRs to deal with technical debt
Generating fix PRs for existing vulnerabilities that have not been addressed

Git repository integration does not take resources from your CI/CD pipeline.
For more details, see Deployment recommendations for SCM integrations.
