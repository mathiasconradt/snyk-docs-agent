Git repository and CI/CD pipeline integrations are commonly used. 
As the following diagram illustrates, you can use a Git repository (SCM) integration to check for issues, including vulnerabilities and license issues, and to prevent pull requests based on policies. You can start by testing and fixing in your development environment and then test, fix, and monitor using a Git repository integration. Use a Git repository integration to improve application security in your Git repository, preventing vulnerable code from entering your codebase and getting quick visibility for your vulnerabilities.
Snyk Integrations
As shown in the diagram, you can add Snyk in the build as a step in your pipeline with CI/CD integration to test, fix, and monitor. Use Snyk in your build to keep your applications secure by preventing the deployment of vulnerable applications or components (registries).
You can implement either Git repository or CI/CD integration, or both. Your implementation will depend on your team's flows and organizational processes.
