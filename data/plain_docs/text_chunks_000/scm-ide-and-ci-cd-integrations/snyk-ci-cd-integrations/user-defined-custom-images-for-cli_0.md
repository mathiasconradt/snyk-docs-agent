Context for user-defined custom images for CLI
Following Snyk announcements regarding Snyk CLI Images and Snyk Images, Snyk is providing instructions that customers will find useful in building their own custom images. You can visit the Snyk Images build tool chain on GitHub for a list of currently supported images. 

Snyk does not build or maintain images that contain end-of-life software by an upstream vendor. The list of unsupported images is available on the GitHub repo.

Using custom images will allow you to extend environment support to any environment supported by the Snyk CLI.
