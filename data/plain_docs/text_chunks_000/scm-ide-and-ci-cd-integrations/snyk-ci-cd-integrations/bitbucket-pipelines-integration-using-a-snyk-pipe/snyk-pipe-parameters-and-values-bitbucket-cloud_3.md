| DONT_BREAK_BUILD                   | Do not fail the build if vulnerabilities are found.Default: false. The build will fail when vulnerabilities are found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| MONITOR                              | Records a snapshot of the Project for the Snyk UI and then continues monitoring the Project after the build is run. See Monitor in the glossary.If the test succeeds, this records a snapshot of the dependencies in the Snyk Web UI and allows you to see the state of your deployed code, have it monitored, and receive alerts when new vulnerabilities are found in the code.Default: false. The Project is not monitored after the initial scan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
