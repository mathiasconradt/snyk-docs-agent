Snyk integration with Bitbucket pipes is supported for the following languages:

JavaScript (npm)
.NET (NuGet)
PHP Composer
Ruby
Docker


Bitbucket pipeline implementation for Java (Maven and Gradle) requires the Snyk CLI.

Language support can be extended through the use of user defined custom images. Using a custom image extends the support to Snyk-supported environments.
