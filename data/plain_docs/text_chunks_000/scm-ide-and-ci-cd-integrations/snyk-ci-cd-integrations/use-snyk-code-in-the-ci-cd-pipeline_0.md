You can use CI/CD integration to test your code for vulnerabilities and ensure your changes do not introduce new vulnerabilities, keeping your applications secure.

Snyk Code is not supported by the Snyk CI/CD plugins, such as the Snyk Jenkins plugin. You can integrate  Snyk CLI with your CI server. 
You can filter the results by severity, for example, fail jobs only when high-severity vulnerabilities are introduced. See Filter results by Severity.
You can export the CLI output to JSON or SARIF standard formats. See  Export test results.
You can generate more visual results using the Snyk-to-HTML tool. See CLI tool snyk-to-html.
