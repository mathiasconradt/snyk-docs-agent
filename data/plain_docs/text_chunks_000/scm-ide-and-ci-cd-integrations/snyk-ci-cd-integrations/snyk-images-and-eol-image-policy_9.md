After the vendor software reaches EOL, that is, stops receiving active support and security updates, Snyk will also stop building and maintaining the impacted image.
Snyk will update the snyk-images repository and user documentation to remove the EOL images from the list of supported images.
For more information, see the lists of currently supported and unsupported images in the snyk-images repository.
