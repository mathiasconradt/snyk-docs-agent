Snyk offers a native plugin for Jenkins that is based on the Snyk CLI, to test and monitor Projects for vulnerabilities in your pipelines.

The Snyk Jenkins plugin supports Snyk Open Source. If you plan to include Snyk Code, Snyk Container, and Snyk IaC scans in your pipeline, use the generic Snyk CLI.

For more information, see the Snyk Jenkins Plugin repository.
