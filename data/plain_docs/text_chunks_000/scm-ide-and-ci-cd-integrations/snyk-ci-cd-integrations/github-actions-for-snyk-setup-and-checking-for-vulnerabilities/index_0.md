Overview of GitHub Actions Integration
Snyk offers a set of GitHub actions for using Snyk to check for vulnerabilities in your GitHub projects. These actions are based on the Snyk CLI and you can use all of its options and capabilities with the args in the properties of the action.
There is also a Snyk Setup Action.
For additional information see the GitHub Actions feature page and the GitHub custom actions documentation.
