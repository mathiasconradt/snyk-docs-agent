Create your own custom image 
Users can create their own custom images to use. This option is available for snyk/snyk-scan >= v1.0.0 only. For details, see User-defined custom images for CLI.
Creating a custom image should guarantee compatibility with your system. However, there are alternative images to which you can upgrade if creating a custom image is not possible.
