This action offers a versatile method to incorporate Snyk into your workflows effectively. Further documentation can be found on our official docs.
You should consider using this action when:

you have a workflow where you already have the development tools installed
you don’t want to depend on a predefined Snyk action for a specific environment, but still want a robust way to setup snyk-cli for your workflows
you can’t find an action built for your specific environment
