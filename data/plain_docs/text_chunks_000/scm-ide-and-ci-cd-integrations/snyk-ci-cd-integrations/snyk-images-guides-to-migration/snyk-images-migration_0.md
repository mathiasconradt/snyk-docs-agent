description: This page explains how to transition away from affected images.
You can create your own custom images to use. This option is available for any user affected by the removal of the Snyk Images listed on this page.
Creating a custom image is the preferred solution, as it should guarantee compatibility with your system. However, if you cannot create a custom image, you can use an available alternative image.

Snyk recommends using a pinned version of a software package unless stated otherwise.
