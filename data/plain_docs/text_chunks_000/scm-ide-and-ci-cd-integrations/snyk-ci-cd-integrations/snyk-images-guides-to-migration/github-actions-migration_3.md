Snyk customers who prefer to move away from pre-built actions provided by Snyk can create custom actions tailored to their specific needs. This approach allows for greater customization and control over the actions used in their workflows.
By rolling your own actions, clients can avoid the effects of future cleanup/removal events when images/actions lose vendor support.
