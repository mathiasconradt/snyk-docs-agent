By default, Snyk uses the https://api.snyk.io endpoint. It is possible to configure Snyk to use a different endpoint by changing the SNYK_API environment variable:

Go to Manage Jenkins, System.
Under Global Properties check the Environment variables option.
Click Add.
Set the name to SNYK_API and the value to the custom endpoint.

For more information see Configure Snyk CLI to connect to Snyk API.
