The Snyk CLI is a NodeJS application that can be scripted directly by developers for easy integration into most CI/CD environments. The Snyk CLI is available as an npm application, pre-packaged binary, or container image. For more information, see Install or update the Snyk CLI.
The Snyk CLI can be configured to:

Return non-zero error codes only when certain criteria are met, for example, exit with an error code only if vulnerabilities of high severity are present.
Output all of its data into JSON for more flexibility.
