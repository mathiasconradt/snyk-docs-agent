Snyk can help if the following circumstances exist:

You containerize each build task but do not mount the Docker socket for security and performance reasons.
Pipeline tasks are split across hosts, or even clusters, and rely on artifacts to be handed off through a central volume or intermediate registry/object store.
You work exclusively in an ecosystem that only uses OCI-compliant container images.

Snyk can provide help as follows:

Run either snyk container test docker-archive:archive.tar or snyk container test oci-archive:archive.tar to get Snyk vulnerability results against tar-formatted container images, either in Docker or OCI format, without relying on the Docker daemon.
The tar archive can be generated by your build process using the equivalent of docker save and stored in a shared volume or object store. This can be accessed by the build agent container running the Snyk binary, with no other dependencies required.
