If you monitor a Project with Snyk, you will be notified if the dependencies in your Project are affected by newly disclosed vulnerabilities. To ensure the list of dependencies Snyk has for your Open Source Project is up to date, refresh it continuously by running snyk monitor in your deployment process. Configure your environment to include the SNYK_TOKEN environment variable. You can find your API token in your Snyk account settings.
