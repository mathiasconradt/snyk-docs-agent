Snyk supports the following approaches to add tests to a build pipeline:

Snyk integration plugins: Snyk provides pre-built plugins for several CI servers, including Jenkins, Team City, Bitbucket Pipelines, and Azure Pipelines.
Snyk CLI: Teams with more complex workflows or using a build system without a Snyk pre-built plugin, can use the Snyk CLI during CI/CD setups. See Setting up using Snyk CLI for details.
Snyk API: For teams with complex requirements, Snyk provides a REST API, which you can use for functions including initiating scans, onboarding new Projects, and testing arbitrary libraries. See the Snyk API documentation for details.
