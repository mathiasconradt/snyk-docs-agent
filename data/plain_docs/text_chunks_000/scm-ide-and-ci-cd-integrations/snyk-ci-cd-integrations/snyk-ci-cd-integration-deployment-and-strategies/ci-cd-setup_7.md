Ensure you do not check your personal Snyk API token into source control, to avoid exposing it to others. Instead, use CI environment variables to configure your token.
See the guidance for how to do this in the following documentation:

Travis
Circle CI
Codeship Basic, Codeship Pro

You can find additional documentation through a web search for setting up env variables in CI.
