Using Snyk as a gatekeeper prevents the introduction of new vulnerabilities (sometimes known as "stopping the bleeding").
After your teams understand the vulnerabilities in their applications, and develop a process for fixing them early in the development cycle, you can configure Snyk to fail your builds, to prevent introducing vulnerabilities into your applications.
Add snyk test to your build or enable the fail functionality to make Snyk fail your builds, providing the results output to the console. Your developers or DevOps teams can use the results to decide whether to stop or continue the build.
For information about snyk test, see the test command help.
