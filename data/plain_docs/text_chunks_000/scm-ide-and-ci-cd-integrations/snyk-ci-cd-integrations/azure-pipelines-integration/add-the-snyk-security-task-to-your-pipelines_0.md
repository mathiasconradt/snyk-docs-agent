Prerequisites to add Snyk Security Task to your pipelines

Ensure you have a pipeline within the repository for the code you want to test.
If you created a pipeline with the Azure Repos wizard, this file is called azure-pipelines.yml.
If this repository has multiple service connections, ask your Snyk admin which to use for your pipeline.
If you want to add your Dockerfile for additional base image data to use when testing your container, ensure the image has been built.
