This extension requires that Node.js and npm be installed on the build agent. These are available by default on all Microsoft-hosted build agents. However, if you are using a self-hosted build agent, you may need to explicitly activate Node.js and npm and ensure they are in your PATH. This can be done using the NodeTool task from Microsoft prior to adding the Snyk Security Scan task to your pipeline.
