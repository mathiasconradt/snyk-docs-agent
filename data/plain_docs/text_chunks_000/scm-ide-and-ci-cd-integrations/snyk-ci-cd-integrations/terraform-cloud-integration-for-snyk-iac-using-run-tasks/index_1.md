Terraform Cloud (TFC) is a SaaS paid platform provided by HashiCorp that provides production-ready state management and continuous delivery for teams using Terraform. It enables teams managing their cloud infrastructure with Terraform to:

Have Terraform state management on the cloud with versioning and out of the box
Have a centralized place for the team to collaborate on their infrastructure, reviewing and approving changes to infrastructure
Have Terraform Cloud manage the remote operations against the cloud providers in an automated way, similar to a CI/CD pipeline, for applying changes to cloud infrastructure using Terraform
