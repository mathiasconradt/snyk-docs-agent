Snyk recommends using the Snyk CLI for CI/CD integrations for the following reasons:

You have the flexibility to test in-progress features of the CLI by using the preview channel.
The CLI provides feature-rich stable releases at a regular cadence.
With the CLI, you have options to extend use cases as you deploy Snyk at scale


When you decide to use a CI/CD Integration, you typically adopt the integration in stages. You will select a deployment method and implement strategies for the code you are scanning. See Snyk CI/CD Integration deployment and strategies.
For detailed information, you can refer to the pages for the integration you are using:

AWS CodePipeline integration
