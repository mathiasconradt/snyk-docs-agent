Do NOT include your API token directly in your pom.xml. Use a variable instead.
You must provide a Snyk API token to access Snyk's services. You can do so by:

Providing apiToken in your configuration using a variable.
Providing a SNYK_TOKEN environment variable.
Authenticating via snyk auth using the Snyk CLI before using this plugin.
