As a final step, you must confirm the details entered are correct.

If you have selected SSO as the authentication method, clicking "Sign up" will then show a loading page while Snyk does the background work.
If you have selected Third-party authentication, clicking "Continue to sign up options" will redirect you to the Snyk Login page where you can choose your identity provider (Github, Google, and so on.). Once you have completed signing up you will be redirected back to the provisioning application where the loading page will indicate in-progress background work.

Snyk advises you to not close the page, otherwise you risk not seeing the process complete successfully.
