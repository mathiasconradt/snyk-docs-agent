You can generate the Broker token by using the API as follows:

Use the endpoint Update Existing Integration to enable Snyk Broker for a specific Organization and a specific SCM. This generates a Broker token in the UI.
To generate a Broker token programmatically, after enabling Snyk Broker, use the endpoint Provision new Broker token to generate a Broker token.\
   You can see the generated Broker token in the API response body and on the Web UI.
Copy and save the Broker token and store it in a secure location for future use, or obtain it later using the Web UI.
