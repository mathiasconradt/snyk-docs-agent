Release status
Snyk Broker commit signing is in Early Access and available only with Enterprise plans. If you would like to use this feature, contact your Snyk account team.

As of version v4.151.0, the Snyk Broker Client supports commit signing for GitHub integration. With a brokered setup, you can sign GitHub commits for fix PRs with your GPG key and a dedicated user you have configured.
