To use the Snyk Broker client with a GitHub Enterprise deployment, run docker pull snyk/broker:github-enterprise. Refer to GitHub Enterprise - environment variables for Snyk Broker for definitions of the environment variables.
If necessary, go to the Advanced configuration page and make any configuration changes needed, such as providing the CA (Certificate Authority) to the Broker Client configuration if the GitHub Enterprise instance is using a private certificate, and setting up proxy support.
