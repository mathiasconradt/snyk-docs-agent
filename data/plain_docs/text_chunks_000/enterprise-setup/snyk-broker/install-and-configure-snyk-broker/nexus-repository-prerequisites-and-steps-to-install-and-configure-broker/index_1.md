Configure Nexus

If you do not see the Snyk Broker switch, you do not have the necessary permissions and can only add a publicly accessible instance.
Submit a request to Snyk Support if you want to add a private registry.

When you have permissions to add a private registry, continue with the instructions to generate a Broker token from the Web UI.
