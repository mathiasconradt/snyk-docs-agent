Before installing, review the general instructions for the installation method you plan to use, Helm or Docker.
The prerequisites follow.
Before installing the Snyk GitHub Broker, you must configure a GitHub service account token with the required permissions. All the operations, both those that are triggered through the Snyk Web UI and the automatic operations, are performed for a GitHub service account that has its token configured with the Broker.
You must have Docker or a way to run Docker Linux containers. Some Docker deployments for Windows run only Windows containers. Ensure that your deployment is capable of running Linux containers.
Continue with the steps to install using Docker or Helm.
