Before installing, review the general instructions for the installation method you plan to use, Helm or Docker.
The prerequisites follow.
Before installing the Snyk Jira Broker, ask your Snyk account team to provide you with a Broker token or generate it from the Snyk Web UI.
You must have Docker or a way to run Docker Linux containers.\
Some Docker deployments for Windows run only Windows containers. Ensure that your deployment is capable of running Linux containers.
To generate a Broker token from the Web UI:

Navigate to Settings > Integrations > Jira > For installation of Jira within a private network click here.
Click Generate to generate a Broker Token for Jira and click Show to confirm.

Continue with the steps to install using Docker or Helm.
