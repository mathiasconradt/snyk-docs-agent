Feature availability
Integration with Artifactory Repository is available only for Enterprise plans. For more information, see plans and pricing. 

Before installing, review the general instructions for the installation method you plan to use, Helm or Docker.
The prerequisites follow.
Before installing the Snyk Artifactory Repository Broker, ask your Snyk account team to provide you with a Broker token or generate it from the Snyk Web UI.
You must have Docker or a way to run Docker Linux containers. Some Docker deployments for Windows run only Windows containers. Ensure that your deployment is capable of running Linux containers.
For convenience, instructions to obtain or generate the Broker token follow. When you are done, continue with the steps to install using Docker or Helm.
