To use the Broker Client with Azure, run docker pull snyk/broker:azure-repos. Refer to Azure Repos - environment variables for Snyk Broker for definitions of the environment variables.
If necessary, go to the Advanced configuration page and make any configuration changes needed, such as providing the CA (Certificate Authority) to the Broker Client configuration if the Azure Repos instance is using a private certificate, and setting up proxy support.
