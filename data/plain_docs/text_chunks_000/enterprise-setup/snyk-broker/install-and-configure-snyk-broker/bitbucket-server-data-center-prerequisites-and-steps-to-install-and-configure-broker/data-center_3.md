The following explains how to configure Snyk Broker to use the Broker Client with a Bitbucket Server deployment using a Personal Access Token (PAT).
To use the Snyk Broker Client with BitBucket, run docker pull snyk/broker:bitbucket-server-bearer-auth. For definitions of the environment variables, refer to Bitbucket Server/Data Center - environment variables for Snyk Broker Basic Auth and Bitbucket Server/Data Center - environment variables for Snyk Broker Personal Access Token (PAT).
If necessary, go to the Advanced configuration page and make any configuration changes needed, such as providing the CA (Certificate Authority) to the Broker Client configuration if the Bitbucket instance is using a private certificate, and setting up proxy support.
