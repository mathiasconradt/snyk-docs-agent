When you configure your Broker Client setup, Git repository webhooks are set to enable automatic Snyk scans, triggered when your developers submit new pull requests or merge events.
Webhook notifications are delivered to Snyk through the Broker Client only for events relevant to Snyk actions: push to branch and open pull request, and only when the event data also shows a scan has occurred. For example, for Open Source, the event data must include a dependency manifest file or a .snyk policy file.
