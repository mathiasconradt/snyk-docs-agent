Install each type of integration and configure using environment variables, as explained for Docker and Helm.
Types of integrations supported with Broker are:

Your Source Code Management (SCM) system (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, BitBucket Server/Data Center, GitLab, Azure Repos)
SCM that is not internet-reachable
Publicly-accessible SCM, allowing you to view and control Snyk activity for increased data security
Your on-premise Jira, JFrog Artifactory, or Nexus installation
Network-restricted container registries
Infrastructure as code (IaC) configuration files on private Git-based repositories

You can also use derived Docker images for each integration and the Container Registry Agent.
For information about advanced configuration as needed for your installation, see Advanced configuration for Snyk Broker Docker installation and Advanced setup for Helm Chart installation.
