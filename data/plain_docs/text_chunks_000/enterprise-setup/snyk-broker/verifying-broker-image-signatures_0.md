Beginning with version 4.169.1, all Broker container images are signed using Cosign.
Cosign is the tool for signing and verifying containers. Cosign Includes storage in an Open Container Initiative (OCI) registry.
Cosign is designed to enhance the security of container images by providing a simple and efficient way to sign and verify them. It leverages the concept of digital signatures, with which you sign the container image with your private key, and the recipient can verify your signature using the corresponding public key.
