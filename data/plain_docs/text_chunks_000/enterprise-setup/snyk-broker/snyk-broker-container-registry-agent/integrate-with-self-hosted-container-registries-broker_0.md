Feature availability
Self-hosted container registries with Snyk Broker are available only with Enterprise plans.
For more information, see plans and pricing.

Snyk can integrate with self-hosted private container registries that are not internet-accessible and can help you to better secure container images in those registries.
To enable and configure your hosted container registry, contact your Snyk team.
