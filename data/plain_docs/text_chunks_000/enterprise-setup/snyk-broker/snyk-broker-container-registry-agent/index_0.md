Feature availability
Snyk Broker Container Registry Agent is available only with Enterprise plans. For more information, see plans and pricing.

The Snyk Broker Container Registry Agent enables you to establish connection with network-restricted container registries so you can scan these registries using the Snyk service.
When you use the Container Registry Agent, Snyk can integrate with private container registries that you host, and help you to better secure container images in those registries. Integration with private container registries allows you to:

Keep sensitive data such as your access tokens inside your private network, never sharing that information with Snyk.
Provide controlled access to the network for Snyk, limiting Snyk access and the actions that Snyk can perform.

This page explains how to use the Container Registry Agent to integrate through Broker with supported open-source container registries as listed on this page. This method of integration is designed for users who require images to be scanned in their own environment instead of inside the Snyk service.
If you do not require that images be scanned in your own environment, you do not need to use the Container Registry Agent. You can integrate with the supported container registries from the integrations page in your account. For details, see Snyk Container security integrations.
