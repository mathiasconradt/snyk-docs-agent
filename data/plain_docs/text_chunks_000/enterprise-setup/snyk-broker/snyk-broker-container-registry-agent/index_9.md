In Elastic Container Registries and other container registries, the communication is the same. The Agent makes synchronous calls to the container registries to list and pull the image. Then the Agent scans the images and sends the results to the Broker Client using callbacks. ECR has a special authentication mechanism that requires setting up an IAM Role or User in the Agent.
