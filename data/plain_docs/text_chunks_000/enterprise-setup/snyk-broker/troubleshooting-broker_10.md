Snyk Code Analysis workflow with Broker
The best way to troubleshoot the Broker with the Code Agent is to understand the communication flow. Traffic travels from Snyk > Broker Client > Code Agent > On-premise Git > Code Agent > Snyk.
The vast majority of problems with the Code Agent are due to traffic being interrupted at one of these points.
