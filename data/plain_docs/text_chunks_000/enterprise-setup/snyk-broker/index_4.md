Snyk Broker is designed to connect Snyk products to self-hosted integrations that are not publicly accessible from the internet. Snyk Broker also allows you to do the following:

Control Snyk access to your network by limiting the files to which Snyk has access and the actions that Snyk can perform.
Manage a fixed private IP for your integration, targeting the Broker.

Snyk Broker includes a Server and a Client, basic components that are the same across all integrations. The Broker Server runs on the Snyk SaaS backend and is provided by Snyk; no installation is required. The Broker Client is a Docker image deployed in your infrastructure. For more information, see Components of Snyk Broker and Connections with Snyk Broker.
See Prepare Snyk Broker for deployment for information about prerequisites, choosing components, network configuration, and credentials.
