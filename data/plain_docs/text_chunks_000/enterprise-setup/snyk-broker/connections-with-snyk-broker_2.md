The Broker Client initiates the outbound connection to establish the WebSocket.
After the WebSocket connection initiated by the Broker Client is established, Snyk can send inbound requests to the Broker Client through the WebSocket.
Thus you do not need to allow inbound connections to the Broker Client from Snyk-specific IP addresses or other external IP addresses.
