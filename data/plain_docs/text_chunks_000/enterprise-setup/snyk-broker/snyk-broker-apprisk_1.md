You can find on GitHub all the updated .json files that include the allowed list of accessible endpoints for the integrations.
As the final step following a completed Broker setup, for any brokered integration you want to add to Snyk Essentials, you must obtain the Broker token. You can find the Broker token in your Organization integration general settings for your integration type, for example, GitHub, GitLab, and so on, as shown in the following image. For third-party integrations, see the next section.
