Feature availability
Snyk Broker is available only for Enterprise plans. For more information, see plans and pricing.

Snyk Broker is an open-source tool that acts as a proxy between Snyk and special integrations, allowing for access by snyk.io to your code to scan it and return results to you. SCM integrations with Broker support Snyk Open Source, Snyk Code, Snyk Container (Dockerfile), Snyk IaC, and Snyk Essentials. For more information, see How Snyk Broker works.
