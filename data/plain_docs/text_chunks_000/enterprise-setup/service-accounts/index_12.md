The new token is also added to your Existing service accounts list, like the list in this example:
Existing service accounts for a Group
In addition, if you created the token for the entire Group with a Group Admin role, the token also appears in the Existing service accounts list for each of its Organizations, though it can only be edited at the Group level.
Existing accounts for an Organization
If you created the token from an Organization that is part of a Group, the token now also appears in the Existing service account list on the Group level. From that list, the Group Admin can also change the token name or delete it.
