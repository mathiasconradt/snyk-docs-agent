Snyk recommends you prepare a tool or script to build a private_key_jwt with the proper claims and sign it with the private signing key you generated.
The JWT should include the claims outlined in the Snyk OAuth 2.0 access token endpoint for the client_assertion property. Note that the aud claim may vary based on the Snyk instance, for example, api.snyk.io or api.eu.snyk.io. For more information, see Regional hosting and data residency.
