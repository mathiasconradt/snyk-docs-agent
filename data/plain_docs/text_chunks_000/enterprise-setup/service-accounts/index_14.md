Administrators can change token names and delete tokens.
What happens to the service account token for a deleted account
When you delete a service account, the API token associated with it is invalidated immediately.
When an account is managed with Groups, the Organization and the Group admins can delete tokens for the Organization; only Group admins can view and manage tokens on the Group level.
Deleting a service account is the same as revoking the API token.
