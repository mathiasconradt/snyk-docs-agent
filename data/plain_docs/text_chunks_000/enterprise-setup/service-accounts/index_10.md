From the Role dropdown list, select an appropriate role.
Roles
For Group service accounts, choose from the following list of roles to configure the scope of the token; Snyk recommends selecting Viewer or Admin.

Group Viewer enables read-only access. Note that to set an API token to be read-only and unable to write to the platform, you must use a service account and set it to Group Viewer. See Snyk API token permissions users can control.
Group Admin enables full administrator access.
Group Member associates a service account with a group but does not grant any specific access.

For Organization service accounts, choose from the standard roles, Org Admin or Org Collaborator, or a custom role if you have set up any custom roles. See Pre-defined roles for the scope of the Org Admin and Org Collaborator roles.
