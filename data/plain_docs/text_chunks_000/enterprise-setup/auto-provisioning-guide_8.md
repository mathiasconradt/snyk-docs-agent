If you have selected SSO as the authentication method, once plan activation is done, you will see a success message and a verification button. Snyk also sends an email to indicate a successful provisioning containing the same login verification link. This link does not expire and it can be used for multiple authentications if needed.\

  Once clicked, a login code will be sent to the email address previously entered. This is known as a Passwordless Login. Enter the code where prompted and you are ready to start using Snyk!

Successful provisioning for SSO

If you have selected Third-party authentication, once plan activation is done you are all set! You can click "Continue to your account" and start using the platform.


Your plan might not have all the features enabled if your contract's start date is in the future. You will gain full access to all features when the start date is met.
