When you work with Snyk from within any third-party tool, Snyk requires authentication in order to initiate its processes.
Snyk offers API tokens to enable integrations with third-party developer tools. You can authenticate through your personal account using your personal token or through a service account using the token associated with that account. When you authenticate through a service account, you do not use any personal token.

For authentication purposes, the third-party identity providers do not require access to your repositories, only your email address.
