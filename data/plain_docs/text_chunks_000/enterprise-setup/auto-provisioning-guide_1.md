You should receive an email in your inbox containing links to start provisioning. Search for "Welcome to Snyk" as a subject, sent from no-reply@snyk.io.
If you have not received this email, look into your spam folder or reach out to your account executive.
This email contains two links:

"Log in and activate your existing account" - To be used if you already have an account and wish to apply your plan to it.
"Create and activate a new account" - To be used if you're entirely new to Snyk or want to start from scratch with a different user.


Once provisioning is complete, these links will become invalid and you will see an "Access denied" error page.
If you have not completed provisioning but still see this error, make sure someone else in your organization has not already completed the flow themselves, in case the welcome email has more recipients.
