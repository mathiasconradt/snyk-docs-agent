These pages provide instructions on how to authenticate and connect while using the Snyk Enterprise plan.
The Enterprise implementation guide focuses on open-source and code analysis. Updates for container and infrastructure as code are planned.
This page looks at how you can get several members of your team involved in trying Snyk to get feedback and buy-in.

If you have been using Snyk on the Free or Team Plan and are looking for guidance on upgrading to the Enterprise plan, see the Enterprise implementation guide.

Snyk has a number of tools and processes that help secure your entire software development lifecycle. With Snyk, you can scan while you are coding or monitor code when you are not working on it. Snyk can also provide visibility into issues across your Projects with a Git repository integration or integrate into your CI/CD through plugins, the CLI, or curated containers.
For users who are evaluating Snyk or planning an enterprise deployment, and for most programming languages, Snyk recommends integrating with a Git repository to get started.

The tool that best serves your tech stack, environment, and workflow depends on your individual circumstances. See Supported languages and frameworks for the guide specific to your language for more details.

To learn more about choosing the best integration points within the software development lifecycle for you and for your team, at their current level of security maturity, see Integrating Snyk at your company.
To see what Snyk can do for you, try out a Project.
The rest of this page explains how to connect a Git repository to Snyk and how to show results from scanning Snyk Projects that are in that repository. The focus is on helping you understand how Snyk works before you start the process of implementing Snyk with your team or teams.

Snyk provides limited free tests per month for each type of scan, Snyk Open Source, Code, Container, or IaC. For unlimited tests, ensure you have a paid plan for the type of testing you need to do, and that the setting for that type has been enabled.
