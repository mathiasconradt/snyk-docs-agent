You can use one of the following identity providers for authentication with Snyk::

GitHub
Bitbucket
Google
Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
Docker ID
Single Sign-On (SSO): available with Enterprise plans.\
  See Setting up Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication.

For additional instructions, see the integrations pages for Git repositories (SCMs).

Logging in with a different provider from the one you registered with when you first created your Snyk account will create a separate new Snyk account.
