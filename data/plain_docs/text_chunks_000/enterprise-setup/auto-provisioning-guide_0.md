Feature availability
Auto-provisioning is available only for customers starting a Pilot or Enterprise plan.

Provisioning is the first interaction you have with Snyk before getting access. You provide answers to the following questions about how you will be using the platform:

What is the name of your business?
Where do you want your data to be hosted?
What is the authentication method your users will access Snyk with?
Do you already have a Snyk account you want to use (a previously completed Pilot) or do you want to start from scratch?
