Set up Single Sign-On (SSO) to allow your developers and teams easy access to Snyk through your existing SSO provider.
The information you need to establish trust between Snyk and the identity provider depends on which type of SSO you are using.
Ensure you have at least one Group and Organization to indicate where new users will be assigned. For details, see Manage Groups and Organizations.

After you gather the needed information identified in the following sections, create a support ticket to request SSO setup.
Alternatively, Group Admins can configure Snyk Single Sign-On. See Self-Serve Single Sign-On (SSO) for the steps.
