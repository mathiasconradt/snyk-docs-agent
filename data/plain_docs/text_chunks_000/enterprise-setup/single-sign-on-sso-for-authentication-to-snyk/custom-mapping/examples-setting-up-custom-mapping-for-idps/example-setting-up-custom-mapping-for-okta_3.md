On the main page of Okta select Directory -> Groups.
Select a Group, navigate to the Applications tab, click Assign application if not already assigned, and choose your Snyk SSO app,. Then click on the pencil next to the displayed Snyk SSO app.
In the Edit App Assignment dialog, add the Snyk Organization slug, and the Organization role name associated with your Okta group (no spaces or capital letters), following the syntax explained in custom mapping (or see legacy custom mapping if you are using that option). 
Repeat the preceding steps for all your applicable Okta groups to assign the org name and role combination to each user within each configured group.
