Custom mapping allows you to dynamically assign users to your Snyk Groups and Organizations based on data provided by your Identity Provider (IdP), in order to implement a scaled user provisioning and access model.

Contact your Snyk account team or Snyk Support to turn on custom mapping once you have completed the setup steps.

To understand more about roles and permissions within Snyk, see Pre-defined roles. See also user role management.
