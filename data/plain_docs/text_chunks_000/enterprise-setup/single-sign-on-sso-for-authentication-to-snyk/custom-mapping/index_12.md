To find the normalized name of a role for use in custom mapping, first confirm that the role exists for the Snyk Group by navigating to it in the Group settings: Group Settings > Member Roles > . 
This will open the role details page that shows which permissions are enabled for the role and also shows the normalized name. Copy this normalized name and use it in custom mapping.
For more details on roles, and specifically, custom roles, see user role management.
