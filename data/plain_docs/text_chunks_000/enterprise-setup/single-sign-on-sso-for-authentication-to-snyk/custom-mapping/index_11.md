For a valid role assertion, the Organization or Group slug may be required, where a wildcard is not used. The slug is the canonical name for the Organization or Group within Snyk.
To find an Organization slug, navigate to the Settings page for the Organization, and under General settings, the Organization slug value is visible. This can then be copied and used in role assertions in custom mapping.
