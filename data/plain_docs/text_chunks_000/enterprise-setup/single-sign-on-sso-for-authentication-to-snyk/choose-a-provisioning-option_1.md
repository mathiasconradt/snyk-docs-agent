With the Open option, all users have automatic access to Snyk by using SSO to log in. They will have access to all Organizations in your selected Group. Their accounts will all be provisioned with the same role, with two options:

The Org administrator role allows all new users to manage other Org admins and collaborators, view Group reports, and work with Organizations within the Group as well as perform non-administrative tasks in the Organization.
The Org collaborator role can perform non-administrative tasks in the Organization.

Let Snyk Support know whether new users will have the administrator role or the collaborator role for the Organization. The selected role applies for all users. For details, see Pre-defined roles.
