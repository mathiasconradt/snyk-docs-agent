You can take advantage of your company's existing identity management system and have employees sign in to Snyk using their corporate identity. This makes provisioning Snyk to users easier. It also allows for deeper integration for Group and Organization membership, role-based access, and more.
Log in to Snyk with SSO
Snyk can integrate with any SAML-based and OpenID Connect (OIDC)-based SSO, as well as ADFS. You can also use your Enterprise Identity Provider for SSO, including Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) and Google G Suite. Read more about SAML in the Auth0 documentation.
Training is available at SSO, authentication and user provisioning.
