After you set up the connection with your Identity provider and provide the necessary details to Snyk Support, Snyk sends you a link to generate a payload.

Ignore any error message you see after clicking this link the first time, as Snyk uses the generated payload to complete the configuration.

When Snyk finishes the configuration, the support agent asks you to navigate to the login page in incognito mode to prevent cookies from interfering with the login process.
Use https://app.snyk.io/login/sso for logging into your production environment.
To complete your login:

Enter your email address.
Select Continue to provider.
Log in with your identity provider as you would for other applications.
Let Snyk Support know which user to promote as the Group administrator.
