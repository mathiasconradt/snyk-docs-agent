In Step 2 of the SSO settings page in the Snyk web UI, enter the details collected from the IdP by providing the sign in URL, sign out URL if available and desired, the IdP signing certificate and domains and subdomains that will be served over the SSO connection.
In case the connection requires HTTP-Redirect protocol binding, change that option from the default HTTP-POST.
Finally, verify if an IdP-initiated workflow should be enabled and then select Create Connection or Save changes if you are modifying an existing connection.
