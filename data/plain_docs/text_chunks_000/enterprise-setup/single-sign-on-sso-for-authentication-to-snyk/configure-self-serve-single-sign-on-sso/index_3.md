Configuring the IdP

In the Snyk web UI, navigate to the Group menu and select Settings.
Select SSO and copy the needed information in Step 1, namely Entity ID, ACS URL, and the Snyk signing certificate URL.
Enter these details in the IdP where appropriate and upload the Snyk signing certificate after downloading it locally in case the IdP does not accept only the certificate URL.
Before moving back to the Snyk UI, copy the IdP provided sign in URL and copy or download the IdP-provided X509 signing certificate details.
