With the invitation required or Group Member option, admins can invite users or users can request access to an Organization.
There are two ways to invite users to Organizations. Invite members (see Manage users in Organizations) or automate the process using the Snyk API Invite users endpoint.
If users who have not been invited use SSO to log in, they will gain access to Snyk, but they will not see any Projects until an admin invites them or manually adds them to the applicable Organizations. You can provide a list of Organizations with the appropriate contact person so that new users can request access.
