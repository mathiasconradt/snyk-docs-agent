Available hosting regions
Snyk offers regional hosting to comply with regional data protection laws and improve service performance. This ensures data residency requirements are met and reduces data latency.
Provisioning is currently enabled for these three regions. Each of these regions is running at least one instance of the Snyk Platform:

:flag_us: United States: SNYK-US-01, SNYK-US-02
:flag_eu: Europe: SNYK-EU-01
:flag_au: Australia: SNYK-AU-01

In the case of multiple instances being available in a chosen region (United States), Snyk reserves the right to chose the specific instance where your account will be created. For more information see Regional Hosting and data residency.

Automated provisioning is only possible for multi-tenant environments. For single-tenant availability (Snyk Private Cloud), reach out to your account team in advance of provisioning.
