The following types of EOL will take place during each cycle:

V1 API: When a GA REST equivalent or equivalents are released, Snyk will aim to include the V1 API in an end-of-life cycle as soon as possible. Users will have a six-month window to migrate off the endpoint, beginning at the public announcement in January and July.
Experimental and beta: When Snyk upgrades a REST endpoint to GA that has earlier experimental or beta endpoints or both, Snyk will aim to include them in the EOL cycle as soon as possible. Users will have a 3-month window to migrate off the endpoint (starting from the public announcement in January and July). 

In exceptional circumstances, Snyk may have to announce an EOL for an endpoint outside of the two announcements each year in January and July. Users will receive a one-month notice of the EOL cycle. The time window to migrate off the endpoint will follow the same windows identified for each type of EOL: a V1 API or an experimental or beta endpoint.
