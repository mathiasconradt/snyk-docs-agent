If you have several Organizations in your Snyk account, before you test your code using the CLI, specify which Snyk Organization will be used for the test count.
You can find your available CLI test count on the Organization Settings page -> Usage tab -> Test Usage section -> Snyk Code field:
Snyk Code allowed test usage
By default, the CLI runs tests under your Preferred Organization, as defined in your Account settings:
Preferred Organization in Snyk Account settings
You can change your Preferred Organization or set another Organization for the CLI tests via the CLI.
When setting an Organization for the CLI tests, you have two options:

Set the default Organization globally for CLI tests
Set an Organization locally for a specific CLI test
