The Snyk CLI enables you to perform the following actions on the results of the snyk code test command:

Analyze Snyk Code CLI results: View test results and analyze vulnerabilities.
Filter results by severity level: Filter the snyk code test results shown in the terminal to display only issues with a specific severity level and higher.
Output test results: Output the snyk code test results to a JSON or SARIF format in the terminal instead of displaying the results in the standard CLI format.
Export test results: Export the CLI Code results to a JSON or SARIF format file.


For snyk code test, the JSON and SARIF formats are the same; thus, examples are shown in only one format.
You can also display the CLI results in HTML format using snyk-to-html.
