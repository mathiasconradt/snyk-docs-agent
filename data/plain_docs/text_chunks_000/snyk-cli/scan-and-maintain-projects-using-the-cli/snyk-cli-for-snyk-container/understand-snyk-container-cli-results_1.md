Snyk SCM scanning supports a subset of Docker Hub images. Other registries are not supported.
If Snyk identifies the base image, and the image uses an Official Docker image, the output includes recommendations for upgrades, in order to fix some of the discovered vulnerabilities.
Example of recommendations to upgrade the base image
This provides a level of situational awareness, showing the vulnerability counts in minor and major upgrades or in alternative base images, which might have fewer vulnerabilities.
