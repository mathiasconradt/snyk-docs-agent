For tests run using the Snyk CLI, only issues defined in the .snyk file are ignored.
For tests run from imported Git repositories, issues can be ignored in the Snyk UI. Note that these ignores apply only to scans done using the Snyk UI.

Ignores in the .snyk file and ignores created in the Snyk UI are not synchronized.
