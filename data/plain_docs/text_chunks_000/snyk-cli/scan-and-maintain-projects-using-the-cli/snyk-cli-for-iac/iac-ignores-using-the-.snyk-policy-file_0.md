When you scan IaC configuration files using the Snyk CLI iac test command, you can ignore issues that are not relevant to you by using the .snyk policy file. Snyk recommends that you store and version the .snyk file in the root of the working directory where you store your IaC configuration files. This file can be created with the snyk ignore command. For details see Ignore vulnerabilities using Snyk CLI.
