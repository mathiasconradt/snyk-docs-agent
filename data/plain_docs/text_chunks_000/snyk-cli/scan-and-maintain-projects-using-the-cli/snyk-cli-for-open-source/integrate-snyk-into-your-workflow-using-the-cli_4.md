Snyk can auto-scan your pull request (PR) for vulnerabilities and license issues in the merge process:
Snyk pull request checks in GitHub
As the PR workflow is completed, Snyk validates the vulnerability and license policy set for the Project. Based on the policy, the checks either passed or failed; this is shown in GitHub.
This allows you to establish a security gate and prevent pull requests from adding new vulnerabilities, or new open-source libraries that do not meet your license policy, to the source code baseline.
