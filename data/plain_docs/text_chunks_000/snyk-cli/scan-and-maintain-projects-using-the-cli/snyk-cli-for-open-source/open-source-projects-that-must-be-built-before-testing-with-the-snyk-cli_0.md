For some types of Open Source Projects, you must build the Project before testing it with the Snyk CLI.
Manifests provide some dependency information. However, other dependencies are resolved only after the Project is built. In addition, lockfiles giving dependency information may not be available before the Project is built.
The following types of Projects must be built before testing with the CLI.
| Language        | Project type      | Build required?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| JavaScript          | npm                   | Build required only if no package-lock.json file is present; run npm install to generate. See the Snyk for JavaScript documentation for supported lockfile versions                                       |

| Python              | pip                   | YesRun pip install -r requirements.txt before testing. Install is required so that the full dependency tree (nested dependencies included) can be tested.Alternatively, pass the CLI --skip-unresolved=true option when testing to test only the dependencies available without building. |
