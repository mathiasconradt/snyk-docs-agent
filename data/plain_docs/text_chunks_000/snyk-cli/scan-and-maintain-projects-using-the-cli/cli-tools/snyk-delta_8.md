If you have trouble, you can try the following:

Run the Snyk test -d step first and ensure it works.
If you are using the delta allprojects script, try removing that and test the Projects individually
If no baseline is found, ensure there is an existing monitored Project first, and check the .git metadata if you are trying to match against an SCM-monitored Project.

If you need help, contact Snyk Support.
