On GithHub, the API rate limit is 5,000 calls per hour for authenticated users as described in this guide.
The snyk-scm-contributors-count tool applies a strict limit of a maximum of 4,500 calls per hour to deal with the rate limit and an additional regulating mechanism to deal with 429 responses ("too many calls").
