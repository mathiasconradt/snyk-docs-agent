What does this tool do?
This tool counts and prints a summary of the contributors count for the last 90 days for any of the following SCMs:

Azure Devops
Bitbucket Cloud
Bitbucket Server
GitHub
GitHub Enterprise
GitLab
GitLab Server


There are some minor differences between the SCMs as to the naming convention. For example: "Orgs" in GitHub can be "Projects" in Azure and "Workspaces" in Bitbucket. These differences are reflected in the commands that the tool accepts for each SCM.
