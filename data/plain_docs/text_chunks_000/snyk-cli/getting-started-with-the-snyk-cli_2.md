After authenticating, you can test your installation. For a quick test, run. snyk --help.
Alternatively, you can perform a quick test on a public npm package, for example. snyk test ionic.
Look at the test command report in your terminal. The report shows the vulnerabilities Snyk found in the package. For each issue found, Snyk reports the severity of the issue, provides a link to a detailed description, reports the path through which the vulnerable module got into your system, and provides guidance on how to fix the problem.
