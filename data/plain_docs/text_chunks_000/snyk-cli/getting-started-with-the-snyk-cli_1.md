To use the CLI, you must install it and authenticate your machine. See Install or update the Snyk CLI and Authenticate the CLI with your account. You can refer to the release notes for a summary of changes in each release. Before scanning your code, review the Code execution warning for Snyk CLI.
Before you can use the CLI for Open Source scanning, you must install your package manager. The needed third-party tools, such as Gradle or Maven, must be in the PATH.
You can also install the CLI in your IDE or CI/CD environment. For details, see the IDE and CI/CD documentation for instructions for each integration.
