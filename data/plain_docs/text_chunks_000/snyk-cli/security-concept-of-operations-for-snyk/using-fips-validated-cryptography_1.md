To optimize the developer experience, Snyk is combining the Snyk Language Server and the Snyk CLI. As a first step, Snyk is bringing FIPS binaries under one application. Later also non-FIPS CLI binaries will be used for Snyk Language Server.
The Snyk Language Server can now be executed as a CLI command.
```bash

snyk language-server
