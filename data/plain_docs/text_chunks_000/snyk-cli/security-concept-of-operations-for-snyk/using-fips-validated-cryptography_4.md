Snyk binaries are available with and without FIPS support. They are all hosted on downloads.snyk.io, differentiated by their Base URL.
FIPS Base URL: https://downloads.snyk.io/fips/
Regular Base URL: https://downloads.snyk.io/
All instructions on how to install and use Snyk remain the same. The only required change is using the appropriate Base URL.
