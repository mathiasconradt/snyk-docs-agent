This functionality is available in the IntelliJ IDE. Snyk is extending this capability to other supported IDEs.

The default channel for all IDEs is the stable channel.
To select a channel from the IDE, choose a CLI release channel using the dropdown, as shown in the screenshot that follows. Users can switch between channels, for example, switch to release-candidate (rc) to receive a hotfix.
However, Snyk also recommends the stable channel as the default for IDE users.
