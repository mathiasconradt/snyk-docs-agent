Effective July 22, 2024, Snyk CLI no longer accepts external contributions.
Due to the CLI's extensive usage and intricate nature, even minor modifications can have unforeseen consequences. Since introducing release channels to the CLI code in April 2024, Snyk's focus has been on stabilizing releases. Snyk believes this open-source, closed-contribution model best serves this goal.
In the spirit of transparency to Snyk customers and CLI users, Snyk will continue working in public. However, going forward, Snyk CLI is closed to contributions.
Snyk appreciates and extends gratitude to the Snyk community.
