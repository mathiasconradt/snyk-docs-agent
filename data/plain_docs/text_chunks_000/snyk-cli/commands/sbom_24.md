Test an individual .NET project.
--packages-folder
Specify a custom path to the packages folder.
This is the folder in which your dependencies are installed, provided you are using packages.config. If you have assigned a unique name to this folder, then Snyk can find it only if you enter a custom path.
Use the absolute or relative path, including the name of the folder where your dependencies reside.
