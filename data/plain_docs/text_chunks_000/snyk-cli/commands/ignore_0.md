Usage and description
Ignore
snyk ignore --id=<ISSUE_ID> [--expiry=] [--reason=] [--policy-path=<PATH_TO_POLICY_FILE>] [--path=<PATH_TO_RESOURCE>] [OPTIONS]
The snyk ignore command modifies the .snyk policy file to ignore a specified issue according to its Snyk ID for all occurrences, its expiry date, a reason, or according to paths in the filesystem for the policy, the issue, or both.
Ignoring issues or vulnerabilities using the .snyk file is not supported for Snyk Code.
