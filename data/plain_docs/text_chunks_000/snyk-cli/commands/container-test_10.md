Allow detection of vulnerabilities in your application dependencies from container images, as well as from the operating system, all in one single scan.
In CLI versions 1.1090.0 (2023-01-24) and higher, Snyk scans for application dependencies in your image by default; you do not need to specify the --app-vulns flag.
In CLI versions 1.962.0 through v1.1089.0, use the --app-vulns option with the --json option to see the operating system as well as application vulnerabilities in JSON format in the results.
