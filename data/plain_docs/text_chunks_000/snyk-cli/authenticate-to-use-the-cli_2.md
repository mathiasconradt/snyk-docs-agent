To authenticate using your Snyk API token, follow these steps:

Run thesnyk auth --auth-type=token CLI command
Log in if you are prompted to do so.
The next page prompts you to authenticate your machine to associate the Snyk CLI or the IDE plugin with your account. Click Authenticate.
After you authenticate successfully, a confirmation message appears. Close the browser window and return to the CLI in the terminal. 

After you complete the dialog, the API token is stored locally for future use. 
All subsequent test commands will be authenticated automatically.
