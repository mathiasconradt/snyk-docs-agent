Introduction to Snyk and the Snyk CLI
Snyk is a developer-first, cloud-native security tool to scan and monitor your software development projects for security vulnerabilities. Snyk scans multiple content types for security issues:

Snyk Open Source: Find and automatically fix open-source vulnerabilities
Snyk Code: Find and fix vulnerabilities in your application code in real time
Snyk Container: Find and fix vulnerabilities in container images and Kubernetes applications
Snyk IaC: Find and fix insecure configurations in Terraform and Kubernetes code
