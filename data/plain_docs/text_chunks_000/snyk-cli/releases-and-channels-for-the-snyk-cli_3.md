Snyk offers a preview channel for those who want to test in-progress features. However, keep in mind that this channel may contain bugs and is not officially supported.

A preview version is not recommended for production environments. It may contain bugs and is best tested in a local environment. For instructions on installing a preview version, see Install standalone executables from a channel.

pre-release builds are deployed regularly up to multiple times a day and contain the latest changes.
