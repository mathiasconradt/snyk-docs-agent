Possible inconsistent configuration
You can configure the CLI in different ways, for example via Environment Variables or configuration file.
If one parameter is configured multiple times, it is probably unintentional and might cause unexpected behavior.
Review configured environment variables and ensure that everything is intentional. If so, you can skip this check by using --no-check.
