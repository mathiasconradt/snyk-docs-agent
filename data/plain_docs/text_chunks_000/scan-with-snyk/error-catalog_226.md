Failed to detect issues
Snyk is always trying to check for new issues and vulnerabilities to keep you safe. We do so by testing on your code on webhook Pull Request events and Push events.
Occasionally you might see a "Failed to detect issues" commit status which may block your PR. This means that we tried to run a test against your changes but unfortunately something went wrong / we encountered an internal problem. If this happens to you try recreating the pull request and if it still occurs reach out and let us know which user, organization and project and commit sha you experienced the issue with on support@snyk.io
