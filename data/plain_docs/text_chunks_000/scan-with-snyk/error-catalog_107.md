Your global.json is targeting an outdated SDK version
Snyk supports the latest channels of .NET which is currently supported by Microsoft, but does not guarantee to support all SDK versions within each currently supported channel.
Within the supported channels, Snyk aims to support most, if not all, of the SDK versions currently released under the newest of the channels.
If the channels currently supported by Microsoft are 8.0, 7.0 and 6.0, Snyk will support all of the latest SDKs released for these channels.
If the SDK versions released under 8.0.3 are: 8.0.203, 8.0.202 and 8.0.103, Snyk cannot guarantee to support all of them, but makes an effort to do so. Snyk will support the latest of the SDK versions currently released by Microsoft. 
If channel 8.0 is the newest channel currently supported, Snyk cannot guarantee that multiple, specific SDK versions for older, still supported channels such as .NET 6.
