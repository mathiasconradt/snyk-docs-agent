Issues are grouped by rule by default.
If you have grouped them by resource instead, you can group them by rule again by selecting the Group by Resource drop-down menu next to the search bar and selecting Rule:
Group by rule
The rules are sorted by severity and then by number of issues, both from highest to lowest.
