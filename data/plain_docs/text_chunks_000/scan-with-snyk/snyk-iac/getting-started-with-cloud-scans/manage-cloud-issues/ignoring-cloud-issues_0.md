You can ignore a cloud issue from the Snyk Web UI.
Ignoring an issue can be useful if the rule that generated the issue is irrelevant for a resource or if you want to defer fixing the issue to a later date.
For example, you might want to permanently ignore an issue resulting from the rule "S3 bucket does not have block_public_acls enabled" for an S3 bucket that is meant to be public.
Or, you may temporarily suppress the issue to address it in the future.
Ignores are applied at the Organization level.
