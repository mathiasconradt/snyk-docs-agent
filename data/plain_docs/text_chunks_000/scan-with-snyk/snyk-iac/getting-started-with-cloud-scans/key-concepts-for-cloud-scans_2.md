A resource is a cloud infrastructure entity such as an AWS S3 bucket; Identity and Access Management (IAM) role; or Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) flow log.
On each scan, Snyk records the configuration attributes of each resource in an environment.
You can use the /cloud/resources Snyk REST API endpoint to retrieve a list of all resources for an Organization and optionally filter by an attribute such as environment ID, resource ID, or resource type.
For a list of supported resource types for cloud environments, see the following:
