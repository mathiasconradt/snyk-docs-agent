A security rule checks cloud infrastructure and infrastructure as code (IaC) for misconfigurations that can lead to security problems. 
An example rule is S3 bucket does not have all block public access options enabled. Snyk can scan the configuration of an AWS S3 bucket to see if it fails the rule and so is vulnerable to a data breach.
