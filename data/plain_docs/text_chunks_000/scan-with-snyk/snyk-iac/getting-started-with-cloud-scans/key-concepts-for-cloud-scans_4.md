An issue represents a misconfiguration that can lead to a security problem. It is associated with a resource and a rule. For instance, an AWS S3 bucket can be tested against the rule “S3 bucket does not have all block public access options enabled.” If the bucket fails the rule, Snyk opens a cloud issue.
After Snyk creates an issue, Snyk keeps it open until the misconfiguration is fixed, at which point the issue is closed.
You can view your Organization's issues in the Snyk Web UI. See View cloud issues in the Snyk Web UI.
