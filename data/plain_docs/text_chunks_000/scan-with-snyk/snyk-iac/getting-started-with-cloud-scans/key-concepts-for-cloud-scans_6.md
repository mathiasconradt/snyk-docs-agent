A compliance control is a specific recommendation or guideline from a compliance standard that prescribes how an Organization should secure systems or infrastructure. Example: control 2.1.5 of CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark (v1.4.0) is “Ensure that S3 Buckets are configured with ‘Block public access (bucket settings)’”. To be compliant with this control, an Organization would enable the “block public access” settings for all of their S3 buckets.
