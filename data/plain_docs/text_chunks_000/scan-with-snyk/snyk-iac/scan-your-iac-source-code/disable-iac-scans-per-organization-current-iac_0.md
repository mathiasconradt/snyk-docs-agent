Disabling IaC scans is possible only at the Organization level. To disable scans for a Group, disable scans for each Organization in the Group.

There might be reasons that you want to disable scans for IaC Projects, either when you import Projects or during recurring tests.
To disable IaC scans for an Organization, navigate to the Infrastructure as code section on the Settings page and use the toggle for Detect configuration files to turn IaC scans on or off, as shown in the following screenshot:
