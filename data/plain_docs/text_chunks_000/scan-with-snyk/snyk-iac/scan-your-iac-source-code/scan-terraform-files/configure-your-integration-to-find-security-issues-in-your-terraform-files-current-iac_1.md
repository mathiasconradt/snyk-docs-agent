Snyk scans Terraform (.tf) files when they are imported from an integrated Git repository. You can scan a Terraform module repository by importing the repo that holds the module from an SCM or by scanning the directory itself using snyk iac test CLI command.
Scanning Terraform files gives you security feedback on everything that is statically configured in the module. To benefit from recurring and scheduled testing, follow best practices and import custom modules directly from an SCM.
See the Snyk blog post about the ability to interpolate variables: Snyk IaC public beta introduces Terraform plan analysis. This allows scanning of the Terraform Plan output with the CLI, enabling scanning of the entire Terraform deployment to include the output of the modules used to create the deployment.
