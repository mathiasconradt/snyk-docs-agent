It can be difficult to understand the internal representation of your input files as you write your Rego code. As you will see when you learn how to write a rule, the input value is a JSON-like object, but the input files could also be YAML, Terraform, or Terraform Plan JSON Output. To help you understand how these are translated into JSON, Snyk provides a parse command.
You will need an IaC file to use as an input file. This input file can also be used when testing the rules, which parses your files into JSON by default.
