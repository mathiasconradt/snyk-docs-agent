Rules in Rego
Rules are written in Rego. When you are writing Rego, you do two things:

Write rules that make policy decisions. A rule is a conditional assignment.
Organize rules into policies. A policy is a set of rules with a hierarchical name

To learn more about the Policy Language, visit the OPA Policy Language Documentation Page.

You can also use the OPA Playground to try out Rego or run examples of this guide.
