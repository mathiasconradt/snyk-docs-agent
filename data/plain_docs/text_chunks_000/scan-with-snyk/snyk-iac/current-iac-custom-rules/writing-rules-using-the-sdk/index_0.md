To get you started with the SDK, you will learn how to:

Parse a fixture file, to help you understand how to write a rule.
​Write a rule with the SDK using Rego.
Add unit tests for the rules you have written to verify your rules.
Build a bundle containing your custom rules so that you can use it with the Snyk CLI.
Push the bundle containing your custom rules to a container registry so that you can enforce its usage with the Snyk CLI.
