Summary:

Snyk platform policies: manage issues
Snyk IaC custom rules: generate issues


The Snyk platform allows you to create your own policies to manage how you prioritize and triage the issues Snyk identifies during scanning. For example, you can define policies to change the priority of an issue from medium to high if it has specific attributes, or to bulk ignore issues if they meet certain criteria.
The Snyk IaC custom rules functionality enables you to define your own rules for misconfiguration checks that you would like to enforce. The result of a custom rule failing on a configuration file is generating an issue.
