Ensure you have followed the steps in Getting Started with the SDK to learn how to generate a bundle of your rules.

With Snyk IaC, you can test your configuration files with the CLI using your custom rules.
There are two ways to use your built bundle:

Using a local custom rules bundle stored on your disk.
Using a remote custom rules bundle by configuring a remote OCI Registry, where your custom rules bundle is already stored.
