Recap\
You have created the Azure app registration, federated identity credential, and service principal for Snyk. Now you can create and scan a Cloud Environment.

The steps follow to create and scan a Cloud Environment for Azure using the Web UI.

In the Snyk Web UI Add Azure Environment modal where you downloaded the Terraform template or Bash script, enter your application ID in the Application ID field.
Optionally, enter an environment name. If one is not provided, Snyk will use your subscription name.\
   
Select Approve and begin scan.
You will see a confirmation message: "Azure environment successfully added." Select Add another environment to return to the Add Azure Environment modal and onboard a new subscription, or select Go to settings if you are finished.

You can now do the following:

View the cloud configuration issues Snyk finds. See Manage cloud issues.
