The role ARN should follow this format unless you changed the name of the role in the Terraform or CloudFormation template:
arn:aws:iam::YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID:role/snyk-cloud-role
If you do not know your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account ID, or if you changed the name of the IAM role in the Terraform or CloudFormation template, you can find the role ARN using the AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console.
