You will start by importing Projects you want to scan with Snyk. In these steps, you choose repositories for Snyk to test and re-test:

Log in to Snyk and on your dashboard, select Projects from the navigation.
On the Projects page, from the Add projects dropdown, select the SCM where the repositories and projects that you want to scan are; for example, select GitHub.
From the list of Personal and Organization repositories, select the Git repositories and projects you want to import for scanning.\
   You can select one or more repositories or projects in a repository.
Click Add selected repositories to import the selected SCM projects and repositories into Snyk.
Select View import Log to see the results on the import log.\
   You can scan multiple types of configuration files simultaneously.\
   The import completes and the Projects page displays the Snyk Project imported.


After you have imported an IaC Project, Snyk re-tests your Project once a week by default. You can de-activate recurring tests on the Settings tab of the Projects page; Set Test & Automated Pull Request Frequency to Test never.
