Snyk IaC can report drift of unmanaged resources. Unmanaged resources are resources that are present on your cloud provider but not on your Terraform state. You can import these resources into Terraform or delete them from your IaaS account.
For information about detecting drift of managed resources, see Command: plan in the Terraform CLI documentation. 
The information in this group of pages supports using the snyk iac describe command. Information is provided about the following:
