With Snyk Infrastructure as Code (IaC), you can secure cloud infrastructure configurations before and after deployment. 
With Snyk IaC, you can:

Write secure configurations for HashiCorp Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) - for IDE, SCM, CLI, and Terraform Cloud/Enterprise workflows.
View issues and receive fix advice so you can make changes directly to code, before applications reach production.
Detect drift and manually created resources in your cloud.
Onboard, scan, and test deployed cloud environments for misconfigurations for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud environments.

For a list of supported IaC languages and cloud providers, see Supported IaC and cloud providers.
