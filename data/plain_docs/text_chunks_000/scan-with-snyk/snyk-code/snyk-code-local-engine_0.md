Release status 
Snyk Code Local Engine is in Early Access and available only with Enterprise plans. If you want to set it up in your Group or Organization, contact your Snyk account team.

Snyk Code Local Engine (SCLE) is a fully contained version of the Snyk Code Engine that allows you to avoid uploading your code to the internet. When you use the Local Engine, only the scan is performed locally. Your scan results are uploaded to Snyk so you can view them on the Snyk Web UI.
This high-level architecture diagram shows the components and their interactions. Snyk scans a request for a Git repository through the Snyk Code Local Engine, which returns the results to Snyk.
