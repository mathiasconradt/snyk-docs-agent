Conditions
To use Snyk Code in an IDE, Snyk CLI, and Snyk API, you must perform the following actions:

Enable Snyk Code in Snyk Web UI
Integrate Git repository with Snyk
Import repositories to scan with Snyk Code

Snyk Code only scans and tests new repositories that are imported to Snyk. If a repository has already been imported, Snyk Code analysis will not be applied. To analyze repositories that have already been imported, you will need to re-import them.
