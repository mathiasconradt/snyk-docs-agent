After you enable Snyk Code and integrate your Git repository with Snyk, you must import the repositories you want Snyk Code to scan for vulnerabilities.
Depending on your existing Snyk account and what you want to do:

If you do not have any repositories in your Snyk account, import your first repository to Snyk.
If you already have repositories in your Snyk account and do not want to import additional ones but want to scan your existing repositories with Snyk Code, you must re-import these repositories.
If you already have repositories in your Snyk account and want to import more repositories to scan with Snyk Code, import additional repositories to Snyk.

Before you import or re-import a repository to scan with Snyk Code, you can exclude certain directories and files from the import by using the .snyk file.
