The predicate is a symbolic representation of a relationship between objects or properties that evaluates true or false. Snyk provides an exhaustive list of predefined predicates. 
For example, all cross-site scripting (XSS) sinks as PRED:XssSink. You can extend these or define your own.  See Query language.
