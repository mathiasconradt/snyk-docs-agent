Snyk Code custom rules work as any other rule. Snyk Code parses your code to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which is analyzed to create an Event Graph. 
All Snyk Code rules, including custom rules, run against the Event Graph, where any match is considered a vulnerability and identified for your developers or security teams.
A vulnerability is removed and added to the resolved issues section within the reporting tab when it has been addressed. See The .snyk file.
