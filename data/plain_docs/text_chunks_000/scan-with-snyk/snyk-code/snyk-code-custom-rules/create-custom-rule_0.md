Requirements for creating custom rules

Before using the feature, you must enable Snyk Code custom rules in Snyk Preview.
To run custom rules against a Project, it must be hosted within a repository. This will have a 1:1 relationship, meaning a .snyk file needs to be present in every relevant repository. 
If you do not have a .snyk file, you can create a file with a .snyk extension and paste the custom rule YAML formatted code into it for the rules to work. See The .snyk file.
