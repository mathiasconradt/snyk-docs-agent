The result history is shown on the History page of the Code Analysis Project. This page displays the snapshots taken when a test was performed. You can review Snyk Code test results for all the testing phases. See Code testing from import to retest.
On the History page, only two distinct snapshots are displayed. A snapshot is deemed unique if either the repository or its associated vulnerability findings have altered since the last assessment, resulting in a snapshot that showcases these changes. If there have been no changes in the repository or the vulnerability results since the last test, the new snapshot will replicate the prior one. Consequently, this will be listed as an additional test run on the History page. This means while the page may present multiple test entries, only up to two will feature distinct results.
