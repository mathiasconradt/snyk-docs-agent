To exclude specific files and directories from being imported by Snyk Code, you need to create a .snyk YAML policy file in your repository. See Exclude directories and files from Project import.
You can specify directories to exclude from the import process using the Exclude dialog box when you import repositories through Git repository. However, this feature is only supported for open-source dependency scans (SCA).
