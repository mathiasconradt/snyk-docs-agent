The Large Language Model (LLM) is trained exclusively on public repositories with permissive licenses. If a license for a repository changes after the initial scrape, the repository is immediately excluded from the training data. DeepCode AI Fix does not use customer data for training purposes.
The data collection process is thorough and includes the following:

Static analysis of permissive public repositories
Automated assessment of the suggested fix qualities
Partial in-house labeling by humans

The training data is ensured to be of the highest quality to optimize the performance of the LLM.
