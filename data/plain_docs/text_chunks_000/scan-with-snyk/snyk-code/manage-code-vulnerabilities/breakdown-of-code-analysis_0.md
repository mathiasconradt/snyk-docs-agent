When you import repositories, Snyk Code automatically tests for vulnerabilities within the imported code. The vulnerabilities detected across all files in a single repository are compiled into a Snyk Project, labeled as Code Analysis. Code Analysis presents the test outcome for a specific repository, listing all discovered vulnerabilities in the repository's source code.
