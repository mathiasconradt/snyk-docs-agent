Data flow shows the location of the discovered issue in your source code and how it flows throughout your application. It shows the taint flow of the issue in the code, with a step-by-step visualization from the source to the sink, presenting the code lines of all the steps in the flow.
The source is the input point of the potential problem. This is a point in the application where a user or an external device can enter data, which will potentially violate the security of the application. For example, in an SQL Injection issue, the source will be a form or any other data input area filled by a user.
The sink is the operation in the code where the application executes the problem. This point must receive clean input, or it can be exploited. For example, in an SQL Injection issue, the sink will be the internal operation that instructs the DB to perform certain actions according to the received input.
Every issue discovered by Snyk Code has a data flow. If an issue has only one step, for example, in the case of hardcoded secrets, the source of the issue will be displayed on the Data flow page.
