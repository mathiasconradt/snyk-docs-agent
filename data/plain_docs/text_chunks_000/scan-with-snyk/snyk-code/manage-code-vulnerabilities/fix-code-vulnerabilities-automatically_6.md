A representation of information flow involved in fixing one issue is presented in the following table.
StageSubsystemDetailsCode scan and   discovery of issuesStatic Code Analysis EngineCorresponds to a normal flow of scanning the code from IDE.Code preprocessing and minimization with respect to the data flow of the particular issue \mathcalStatic Code Analysis EngineData flow of \mathcal is analyzed and code is minimized, keeping the relevant context only.Generating k candidate fixes for the given issue \mathcalNeural Network (Generative LLM)Here, k is an implementation parameter.Candidate fixes ranking and self-assessmentStatic Code Analysis EngineEach of the  k fixes is assessed by the Code Engine, filtering out those rendering invalid code or failing to fix the issue (the issue persists).Returning the best candidate fix The system has finished.
