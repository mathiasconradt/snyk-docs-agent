The Projects page on Snyk Web UI has a filter pane that categorizes Snyk Projects and shows the number of matching Projects for each criterion. See Project information.
The Grouping by File or Vulnerability Type feature offers the following additional options:

Grouping by File: This option helps identify specific files that contain multiple vulnerabilities, enabling you to focus on problematic files that may need more rigorous review or refactoring.
Grouping by Vulnerability Type: This option categorizes vulnerabilities by their type, such as SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), assisting in addressing the most prevalent types of vulnerabilities within your codebase.

Refer to the respective sections in the Snyk User Documentation for detailed examples and usage scenarios.
