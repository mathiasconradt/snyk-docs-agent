If you want to check for the most recent vulnerabilities in your repository, you can do a manual test by selecting the Retest now option. This will trigger Snyk Code to take a fresh snapshot of your repository and analyze its source code files. The results will then be displayed on the Code Analysis page. Take into consideration that Snyk counts a manual test as a new test. See What counts as a test?
You can also use the Retest now option to apply the exclusion rules of the .snyk file to an imported repository. See Exclude directories and files from Project import.
