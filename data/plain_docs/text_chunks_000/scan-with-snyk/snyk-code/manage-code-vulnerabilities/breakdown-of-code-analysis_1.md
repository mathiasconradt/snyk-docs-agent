ComponentDescriptionHeaderIncludes the details of the imported repository with a link to the repository in the Git repository, the Project name, and the Projects tabs: Overview, History, and Settings.The Project Summary Information areaIncludes the dates of the repository import and the last test of the repository, the Retest now option for an on-demand test, the name of the user who imported the repository, the name of the Project owner, and the number of code files that were analyzed and not analyzed. See Retesting code repositoryProject filtersIncludes a set of pre-defined criteria for filtering the displayed issues.Vulnerability issuesIncludes the vulnerability issues that Snyk Code discovered in the imported repository.Data flowDisplays the taint flow of the issue in the code.Fix analysisProvides additional details about the discovered vulnerability type, best practices for preventing this issue, and code examples of fixes.CWEThe CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) ID of the specific vulnerability type and a link to the CWE website, where this vulnerability type is described. See Example: CWE-22: Path Traversal.Open repository external linkQuick access to the integrated Git repository for immediate remediation.Imported byThe Git repository username who imported the analyzed repository.Project ownerIdentifies the lead for the Project in your Organization for administrative purposes only; it does not impact the Snyk Project itself. This is not a required field and is left blank by default. EnvironmentThe Environment attribute describes the software's context, ranging from client-side (Frontend) to server-side (Backend), private (Internal) to public (External), across platforms like Mobile, Cloud (SaaS), On-Premises, Hosted services, and Distributed systems.Business criticalityWhen the Risk Score feature is enabled, the Business Criticality attribute automatically influences the score, scaling it to the most significant attribute level. See Risk Score.LifecycleThe Lifecycle attribute categorizes a Pro, Development, or Sandbox.TagsThe Snyk Project tags feature enables the addition, removal, and use of custom metadata tags to organize and filter Projects, simplifying Project management and navigation.Analysis summaryThe number of code files analyzed in the repository and the percentage of the analyzed files out of the total repository code files.Repo breakdownAnalyzed Files: Includes files that have been reviewed by Snyk Code, encompassing recognized extensions and programming languages.Unanalyzed Files: Consists of text files yet to be analyzed because of unsupported languages or extensions.Unknown: Files without recognized extensions, potentially including multimedia content (such as pictures and videos), binaries, proprietary format files, or any other formats that fall outside Snyk Code's scope of interest.
