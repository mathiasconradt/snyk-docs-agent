If you've already set up an integration for the first time and enabled Snyk Code, you can check if the setting is still valid before importing repositories.

Log in to the Snyk Web UI and select your Group and Organization.
Navigate to Settings > Snyk Code.
In the Enable Snyk Code section, change the setting to Enabled.
Click Save changes.

The next step is to integrate your Git repositories with Snyk.
