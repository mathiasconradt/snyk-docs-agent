If you want to test repositories already imported to Snyk before the Snyk Code option was enabled, you need to re-import them (see Snyk Code conditions).

Log in to the Snyk Web UI and select your Group and Organization.
Navigate to Projects > Add projects.
In the Enable Snyk Code section, change the setting to Enabled.
Select the Git repository containing the repositories you want to re-import.
On the Personal and Organization repositories page, select the repositories you want to re-import to Snyk. Repositories that have already been imported are indicated with a checkmark.
Select Add selected repositories to re-import the selected repositories.

Your selected repositories are re-imported to Snyk. During the re-import process, Snyk Code analyzes these repositories, and a Code analysis Project is added to each repository, containing the results of the Snyk Code test.
