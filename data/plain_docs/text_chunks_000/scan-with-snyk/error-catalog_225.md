Merge conflict error
Merge Conflict Error is not a Snyk specific issue but rather some issues on your SCM environment. As an example, merge conflicts could happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.
To resolve this, you might need to figure out all the merge conflicts on your SCM environment and resolve them to fully remediate these types of errors on Snyk. As a note, this cannot be modified/changed on Snyk's side.
