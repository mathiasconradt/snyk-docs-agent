Unsupported external file generation
Snyk currently does not support external file generation in your project. This limitation is due to Snyk's lack of visibility into the third-party generator tools you may be using and the specific commands required to generate these files.
Snyk can only work with the files available in your repository and does not have insight into the generation process for external files.
