Snyk Fix PRs
Fix pull or merge requests are created automatically by Snyk when new issues are identified in Project tests or a retest is run on a Project that has identified vulnerabilities. This feature applies to Projects imported through an SCM integration such as GitHub Enterprise or Azure.
For more information on how integrations use fix and upgrade pull requests, see Upgrade open source dependencies with automatic PRs.
For instructions on opening pull requests from a GitHub account, see Opening fix and upgrade pull requests from a fixed GitHub account.
