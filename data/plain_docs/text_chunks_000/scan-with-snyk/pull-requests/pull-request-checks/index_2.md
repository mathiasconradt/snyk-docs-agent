The Snyk PR Checks feature runs live tests of the “before and after” branch with the PR and fails only if the new branch has more issues. This allows you to address problems that have been introduced since the last scan, for example, new vulnerabilities introduced externally. Snyk PR Checks are triggered by a change in your code, and find issues across the entire repository. Thus,  a PR check finds issues in your code as well as other issues introduced since the last Snyk scan.Use the Snyk PR Checks feature to prevent new security issues from entering your codebase by automatically scanning code changes in real time as soon as you submit a pull request (PR) in your source code manager (SCM).
