The Snyk PR Checks feature allows you to test a change to the current codebase to see if that change introduces a problem. This change testing makes it easier to maintain the security of your codebase on an ongoing basis.
For developers, change-related flaws are relevant and easy to fix, and fixing change-related flaws rather than accumulated flaws makes rolling out secure code easier. You can detect security issues early in the development process, see the test results immediately after you write new code, and find and fix issues as they emerge, all in your native workflow.
