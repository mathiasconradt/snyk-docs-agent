You can analyze the changed code with PR Checks as follows:

Snyk Code: Source code changes result in a vulnerability that exceeds a specified threshold. A full scan of the repository is done to determine if there are new vulnerabilities.
Snyk Open Source: Snyk analyzes dependency manifest or supported files for known security vulnerabilities that meet a threshold, such as exceeding severity, or checks to determine whether a fix is available.
Open Source license check: Snyk validates package licenses against the configured policy for license policy violations.

PR Checks also support all programming languages and frameworks supported by the Snyk Code and Open Source engines. For more information, see programming language support for Snyk Code and Open Source.
