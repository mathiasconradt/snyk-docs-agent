You can configure PR Checks either at the Integration level for your Snyk Organization or for specific Snyk Projects in an Organization.

In your Organization, you can have multiple repository integrations, but the feature works only for those integrations that have PR Checks configured.
At the Project level, the settings are inherited from the integration by default, but you can configure custom settings.
