| Automatically scanned pull request            | Scan code changes in real-time as soon as a pull request is submitted, to catch potential issues before they go into production.                                                                                                                            |
| Results displayed in your source code manager | Make use of security reviews and notes left by Snyk on your pull requests.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Code change testing for security issues       | Test changes to your codebase for any security issues, ensuring that your code stays secure over time.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Branch testing                                | Test branches before and after implementing changes to fail only if the new branch has introduced issues. Prevent merging pull requests with failed security issues. Note that Snyk monitors all pull requests made to the monitored repository. |
