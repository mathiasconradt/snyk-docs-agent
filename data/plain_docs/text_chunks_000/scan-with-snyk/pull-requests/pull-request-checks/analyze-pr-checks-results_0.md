PR Checks results
After you submit a pull request to fix vulnerabilities, PR Checks detects issues with a severity level that meets or exceeds your configured threshold and provides a report. Examine the report status and result to decide whether to merge the pull request.
You can change the default severity threshold either at the Integration level, or at the Project level.
