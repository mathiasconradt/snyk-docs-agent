The description of your PR will be: 
```yaml
The PR will fix 98 issues.
```
product_is_container: boolean
This variable can be used to customize attributes based on whether the PR is a Container product. Currently there are two different product types at Snyk which can open PRs (Open Source PRs and Container Prs). Using this variable will help you customise your template to differentiate between the two.
