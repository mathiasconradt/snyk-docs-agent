Fix PR Threshold by score
Snyk will create Fix PRs only above the threshold you set in the Score field. The score type you use will display as the option for the dropdown. This threshold ranges from 0-1000.
The set defaults for score are as follows:

Organizations created before December 5, 2024 have a default score of 0.
Organizations created after December 5, 2024 have a default score of 700.
After June 5, 2025, all Organizations will have a default score of 700 unless you have configured a score in the setting.
