Follow these steps to generate a PR or MR directly from your Project in the Snyk Web UI:

Navigate to your Project from the Project list
Select the Project.
Select Open a Fix PR/MR or Fix this vulnerability. A preview screen appears, showing you what fixes will be applied.
Click Open a Fix PR on this screen to generate the pull request.


PRs use a branch naming convention based on the issues that they fix. When a PR already exists for a specific change, Snyk does not create a new one, even if the original PR is closed. If you try to create a fix PR that duplicates an existing one, an error may be displayed. If this happens, check to see if the branch already exists and re-open it.
