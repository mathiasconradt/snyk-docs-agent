In addition to fixing advice, Snyk can automatically create pull requests (PRs) on your behalf to upgrade your dependencies based on the scan results. To create PRs automatically in implementations with Snyk Broker, your administrator should first upgrade to v4.55.0 or later.

For the basic steps in fixing vulnerabilities, see  Fix your vulnerabilities. To ensure your language is supported, see Languages supported for Fix Pull Requests or Merge Requests and Supported browsers pages.


Administrators and account owners can manage the settings for Snyk upgrade pull requests from the Snyk Web UI at both the Organization and Project levels. You can configure whether the feature is enabled (which is the default) and specify the conditions under which Snyk should submit upgrade pull requests, if at all.

Snyk provides actionable fix advice for vulnerabilities in your Open Source libraries through the following:

#automated-snyk-prs: automatic pull and merge requests
#manual-snyk-prs: manual pull and merge requests
