You can configure Automatic fix PRs to work only for specific Projects rather than having Projects inherit the settings from the global integration.

Navigate to Projects and expand the target containing your Open Source Project.
Navigate to Settings and select an integration, for example, GitHub.
In the Automatic fix pull requests section:
Select Customize for only this project
Enable Known vulnerabilities (backlog)
Select the Fix Strategy for your Backlog PRs as described in the Fix strategy step of configuring for integrations.
Click Save changes.
