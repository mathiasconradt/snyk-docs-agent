You can configure Snyk to check your dependency health regularly, recommend dependency upgrades, and automatically submit PRs for upgrades for an entire Organization or a specific Project. After configuration, Snyk automatically creates PRs for all the necessary dependencies as upgrades become available for the scanned Projects.
By default, the Project Settings inherit the Organization Settings. However, when the Settings on the Organization and Project levels are different, the Project Settings override the Organization Settings.

Automatic dependency upgrade PRs are available only for the following SCM integrations: GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and Bitbucket Cloud.
