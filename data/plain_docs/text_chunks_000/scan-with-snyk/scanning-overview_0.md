Scans may be limited on your account, depending on your Pricing Plan. For more information, see What counts as a test?

Snyk takes a developer-first approach to secure your development work by integrating directly into your IDEs, workflows, and automation pipelines to add security expertise to your toolkit. This approach allows you to:

Use Snyk to focus on early enablement, not later enforcement.
Run scans while working on a Project, before you commit any code. This minimizes rework by finding issues that require changes early on.
Add and test packages before writing the code that interfaces with each package.
After writing a major section of code, scan it to find issues before continuing work.
