You have the necessary permissions to onboard cloud-based SCM tools (Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitLab, and so on) to Snyk AppRisk for repository asset discovery.


When you integrate a Git code repository with Snyk Essentials, you should use a secondary token with a broad, complete view of the code repository, not only of what you imported into Snyk. \
Use a secondary token to counterview everything onboarded using Snyk. \
Using the secondary token reduces the likelihood of introducing a blindspot from a limited token at the Organization level configuration. \
The first import, synchronization, can take up to 24 hours to complete.
