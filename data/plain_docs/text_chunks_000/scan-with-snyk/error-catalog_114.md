OAuth re-authorization required
Your code is cloned on an isolated environment using Git as it is required by Snyk to analyze its dependencies.
Your Organization has enabled or enforced SAML SSO after you authorized Snyk to access your code, and a re-authentication is therefore required.
The error you're seeing is usually reproducible by attempting to do a git clone of your repository with incorrectly configured credentials.
Verify your authentication configuration with your Git cloud provider and try again.

Error has been deprecated
Reason: This error has been moved to a more generalized namespace to avoid repetition.
