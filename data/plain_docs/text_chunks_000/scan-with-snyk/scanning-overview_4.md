If you see hundreds or thousands of issues when first scanning your application, prioritization of issues becomes important. For more details, see Prioritize your issues.
Snyk offers capabilities to address issues both reactively and proactively:

Being proactive
Use Snyk Advisor to identify better packages to begin designing.
Use the CLI and IDE plugins to test while developing.
Add a package, ensure it is installed, and scan for security before writing your code.
Fix advice\
  Snyk provides this advice across integrations, calculating the top-level package requiring an update in the package manifest or how to update the line of code to make it secure and displaying the advice on results screens.
Automation
Snyk can create automatic fix pull requests when a new vulnerability is detected with a fix available.
You can enable dependency upgrade-related pull requests created when new versions of a package are available. This helps with technical debt by providing PR nudges to update dependencies.
