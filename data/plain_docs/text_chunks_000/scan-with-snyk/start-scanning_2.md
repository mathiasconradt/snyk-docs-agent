A scan runs when you import a Snyk Project (see Import a Project to scan and identify issues or click the Retest now button on a Project. Snyk then automatically runs periodic scans on that imported Project, to see if your code is affected by newly disclosed vulnerabilities.
See Explore Snyk through the Web UI.
The default scanning frequency and available frequencies vary depending on the type of Project: for more information, see Usage settings. You can also set the frequency in the Project Settings (see View and edit Project settings) or use the API Endpont Updates project by project ID.
