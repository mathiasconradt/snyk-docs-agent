No target frameworks found in manifest files
Snyk was unable to detect any <TargetFramework>s in the supplied manifest files. 
If you are using Directory.Build.props files to determine the target framework, ensure that it is named as such. Due to performance considerations on the customer's SCM network, Snyk does not perform case-insensitive searches for .props files.
