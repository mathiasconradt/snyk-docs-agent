When the Detect application vulnerabilities feature is enabled, it allows you to see:

Dependency vulnerabilities and licensing issues of manifest files detected in your container image
Vulnerabilities detected in operating system packages.

When an image is imported to Snyk, it appears under its registry record in the Projects view, showing the operating system vulnerabilities found in your image.
With this feature enabled, you can also see nested manifest files detected in the image and their vulnerabilities and licensing issues.
