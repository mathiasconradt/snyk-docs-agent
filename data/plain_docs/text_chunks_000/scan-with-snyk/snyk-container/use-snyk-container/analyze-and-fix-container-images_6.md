When providing public base image recommendations, Snyk bases its logic on the origin repo, flavor, and version of the base image it detects.
The Snyk recommendations for upgrading the base image refer to:

Minor upgrades: the safest and best minor upgrade available
Major upgrades: an option for a major upgrade that will reduce more vulnerabilities but with greater risk
Alternative upgrades: viable image options for replacing your current base image with possible different base images that provide the least amount of vulnerabilities.
Recommendation to rebuild your base image if it is outdated.

Recommendations for upgrading the base image include:

The name of the recommended base image version
The number of vulnerabilities that exist in the recommended upgrade
A summary of the vulnerability severities.
