Depending on your Project settings, Snyk scans the image regularly. Based on your configuration, Snyk updates you by email or Slack whenever new vulnerabilities are identified in both the operating system and application dependencies.
You can set the scan frequency for each Project. The default is daily testing. To update the scan frequency, navigate to the Settings tab on the Project page and select the frequency from the dropdown. The options are never, daily, or weekly.
