Snyk Container CLI supports scanning Java applications embedded in container images as JARs or uber -jars. In the case of uber-jars or shaded jars, Snyk uses the pom.properties manifest file to resolve package versions and dependencies. The presence of the pom.properties file in a JAR file depends on how the JAR was built and what tools and configurations were used during the build process.  Maven and Maven Shade Plugin built JARs include pom.properties manifest file by default.
