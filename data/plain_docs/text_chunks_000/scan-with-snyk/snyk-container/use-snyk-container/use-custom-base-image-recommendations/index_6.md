The applications team that is responsible for using pre-built custom base images and adding additional layers on top of the pre-built images for applications performs this step.
First, import an image to a new Snyk Project. Ensure that the Project is in the same Group as the custom images. You can import an image using either the CLI or the Web UI.

If the same image is scanned from both the CLI and Web UI, Snyk creates two Projects and monitors both.
