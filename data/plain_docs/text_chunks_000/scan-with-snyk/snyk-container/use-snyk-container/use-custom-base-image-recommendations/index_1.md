When scanning a container image, Snyk provides recommendations based on the base image it detects. Because Snyk precomputes recommendations only for Docker Official Images, these recommendations apply only to a subset of images.
Customers often maintain their own internal base images, built on top of Docker Official Images or other upstream images. These are provided as a service to a wider set of development teams. For example: somecompany/base-python:3.12.1.
The Custom Base Image Recommendation feature (CBIR) allows Snyk to recommend an image upgrade from a pool of your internal images. This allows teams to be notified of newer and more secure versions of their internal base images.
