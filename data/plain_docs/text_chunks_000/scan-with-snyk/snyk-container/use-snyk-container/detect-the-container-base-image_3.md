If the base image is a Snyk-supported image, the results include recommendations for upgrades to resolve some of the discovered vulnerabilities.
This allows you to see vulnerability counts in minor and major upgrades and in alternative base images, which might have fewer vulnerabilities. Based on this information, you can decide whether to upgrade your base image and which one is the best.
You can see the base image vulnerabilities in your Project among the vulnerabilities added by your instructions, sorted by their priority score.
