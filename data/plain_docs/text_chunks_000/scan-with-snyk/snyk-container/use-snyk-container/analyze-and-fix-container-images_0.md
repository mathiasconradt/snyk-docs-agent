You can import container Projects into Snyk using the CLI command snyk container monitor. Alternatively, you can import Projects directly from a supported container registry using the Snyk Web UI.
Snyk imports a snapshot of your container image and then scans the snapshot for vulnerabilities. Based on your configuration, daily or weekly, Snyk regularly scans the dependencies snapshotted in that original import, which in turn refers to its tag. Based on your configuration, Snyk sends you an update by email or Slack when any new vulnerabilities are identified.
If the tag for an image changes and the original tag is used for a different image, upon rescanning (daily or weekly), Snyk detects changes to the Linux package dependencies and creates a new snapshot of that Project, but it does not detect changes in the application dependencies and thus does not update the snapshot for application vulnerabilities.
This means that if you frequently reuse a tag to refer to a different image, you must reimport the other image so that Snyk can update the application dependencies.
