Snyk detects vulnerable base images by scanning your Dockerfile when you import a Git repository. This allows you to examine security issues before building the image and thus helps solve potential problems before they land in your registry or in production.

When scanning Dockerfiles, Snyk can provide vulnerability information and base image recommendations for supported base images. If you need help, contact Snyk Support.

After you integrate your Git repository with Snyk, any Dockerfiles in that repository are automatically identified and shown in the Web UI as Projects.
