Snyk Container allows you to analyze your Dockerfile and scan base images from the Dockerfile.
Prerequisites for Dockerfile analysis
Before using Dockerfile analysis, ensure that:

The account you integrate Snyk with contains the relevant Dockerfile repository.
You configure the integration for the Git repository that contains your Dockerfile. For more information, see Supported SCMs for Dockerfile analysis.
You have already imported the relevant container Project for monitoring.
