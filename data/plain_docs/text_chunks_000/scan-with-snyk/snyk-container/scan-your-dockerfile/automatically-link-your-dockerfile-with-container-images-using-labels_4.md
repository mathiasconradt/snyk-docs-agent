To create a link, Snyk must be able to map the Dockerfile repository URL to the right SCM Organization source. For brokered integrations, the process is more complex, as the URL is not available by default.
To create automatic links between container images to Dockerfiles stored in brokered SCMs, enter the URL in the integration settings page.

When the URL is available, Snyk can use it to generate links.
