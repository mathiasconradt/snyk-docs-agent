Using the same integration ID, you can import multiple clusters to one Snyk Organization by giving clusters a unique cluster name during installation.
You can also import one cluster to multiple Snyk Organizations in manual import by cloning an integration across your Snyk organizations, so the integrations have the same integration ID. 
One Snyk Organization has a limit of 25,000 Projects. For more information, contact your Snyk admin.
