Relative importance asserts a common severity for a vulnerability and shows the underlying detailed information for that severity based on multiple sources. This allows developers and analysts to view a common level of importance and exposes the underlying information that contributed to the asserted severity. 
Snyk supports relative importance in Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, Amazon Linux, Oracle Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES).
