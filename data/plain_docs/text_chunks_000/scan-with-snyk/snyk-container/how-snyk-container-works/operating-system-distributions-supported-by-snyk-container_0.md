Snyk detects vulnerabilities in images based on operating systems listed on this page along with the specific versions that are supported. For the latest updates, see Snyk updates.
If you use an unsupported distribution, for example, one that has reached its end of life (EOL) and is no longer being maintained, Snyk displays a message to tell you the distribution is unsupported. Due to a lack of security updates for unsupported distributions, it is possible that you will not receive notifications about vulnerabilities. However, it does not mean that your image is secure.

Snyk also supports images using packages from these distributions, but without the associated package manager, such as Distroless images.

This is the list of supported operating systems and distributions:
