This error occurs when importing images from Docker Hub fails, and you receive the error Unauthorized access or Resource does not exist.

This error occurs because your image is private on your Docker Hub account. To resolve this, navigate to your repository's Settings > Visibility settings section in Docker Hub and make the image public.
