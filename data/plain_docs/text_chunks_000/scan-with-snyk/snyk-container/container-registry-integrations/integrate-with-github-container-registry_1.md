Prerequisites for GitHub Container registry integration

You must be an administrator for the Organization you are configuring in Snyk.
Snyk needs user credentials to integrate with GitHub Container Registry and does not support GitHub Container Registry when configured for single sign-on (SSO). However, you can use a Personal Access Token (PAT) with SSO when the token is authorized with theread:packagesscope.
