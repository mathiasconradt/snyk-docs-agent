Depending on your needs and context, in order to monitor for new vulnerabilities in container images, Snyk recommends choosing one of the following integration points: CLI, a container registry integration, or Kubernetes integration. By choosing only one of these testing methods, you can ensure the best outcome when identifying vulnerabilities and reduce noise.
Because the Snyk CLI is highly customizable with CLI options, it has the broadest scope of all the integrations. You can run snyk container monitor as part of your continuous deployment pipeline and capture a snapshot of the container image as it is being deployed. For more information, see Snyk CLI for Snyk Container.
