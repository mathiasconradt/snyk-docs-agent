In your Snyk account, navigate to Integrations from the menu bar at the top. Under the Container registries section, find the Nexus option and click it.
In the Account credentials section, enter your Nexus username and password login credentials. In the container registry name field, fill in the full URL to the registry you want to integrate with.
To finish, click Save.

If you are using a self-hosted Nexus registry, contact Snyk Support to provide you with a token. For more information, see Snyk Container for self-hosted container registries (with Broker).
Snyk tests the connection values, and the page reloads, now displaying Nexus integration information. The Add your Nexus images to Snyk button becomes available.
If the connection to Nexus fails, a notification appears under the Connected to Nexus section.
