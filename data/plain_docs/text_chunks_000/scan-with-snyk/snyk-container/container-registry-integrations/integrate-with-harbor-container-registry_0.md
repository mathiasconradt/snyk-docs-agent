Snyk integrates with Harbor Container Registry to enable you to import your container images and monitor them for vulnerabilities.
Snyk tests the images you have imported (referred to as Projects) for any known security vulnerabilities, testing them at a frequency you control, and alerts you when new issues are detected.
Follow these instructions to set up Harbor integration in Snyk and start managing image vulnerabilities.
