Snyk integrates with GitLab Container Registry to enable you to import your container images and monitor them for vulnerabilities.
Snyk tests the images you have imported (Projects) for any known security vulnerabilities, testing them at a frequency you control, and alerts you when new issues are detected.
Integration with GitLab Container Registry is available for all Snyk users.
This page explains how to set up GitLab Container Registry integration in Snyk and start managing image vulnerabilities.
