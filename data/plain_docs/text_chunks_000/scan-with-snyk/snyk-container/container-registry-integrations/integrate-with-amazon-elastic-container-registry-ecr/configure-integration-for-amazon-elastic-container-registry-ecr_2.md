To enable integration, you must first create a read-only AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. The role delegates read-only access to all repositories in your registry for Snyk per Organization by indicating the list of permitted Snyk-assigned Organization IDs.
After you create the IAM role, when integrating additional organizations, you can add the additional Organization IDs as needed.
