Snyk integrates with Google Container Registry (GCR) so you can import your Projects, monitor your containers for vulnerabilities, and fix vulnerabilities as you work. Snyk tests the Projects you have imported for any known security vulnerabilities at a frequency you control.
Refer to the following pages for details:

Enable permissions to access GCR
Configure integration for GCR
Add images to Snyk from GCR
