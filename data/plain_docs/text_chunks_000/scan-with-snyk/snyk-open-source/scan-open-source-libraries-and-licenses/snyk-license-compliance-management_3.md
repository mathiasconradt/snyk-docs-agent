Each policy contains rules detailing which licenses are acceptable and which are forbidden for use, together with a severity level that indicates how severe the license violation is. For example, severity levels for internal-only license issues may be less severe than for those released externally.
You can create and edit multiple license policies for Organizations. For details, see Create a license policy and rules.
