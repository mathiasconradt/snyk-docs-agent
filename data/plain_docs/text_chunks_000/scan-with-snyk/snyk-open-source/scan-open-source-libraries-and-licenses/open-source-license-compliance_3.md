You can view an inventory of all of your licenses across all your Projects. For more information, see View licenses.
Different customers may have different needs and tolerance levels for different license types. Snyk encourages you to ensure you have made the needed changes or created new policies that fit your company's specific requirements.
New licenses added by Snyk will inherit the Unknown license type severity. In cases where this severity was not set to None, newly added licenses will appear in the license compliance results.
If you notice a license with the wrong license type assigned to it, you can contact Snyk support. Snyk will investigate the request and update the license type if needed.
