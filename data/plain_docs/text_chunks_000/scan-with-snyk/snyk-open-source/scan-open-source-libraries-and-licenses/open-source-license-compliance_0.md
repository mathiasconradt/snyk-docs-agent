Overview of licenses
Every time you test your code in the Snyk Web UI, the Snyk CLI, or using PR Checks, your repositories are scanned for vulnerabilities and license compliance. This includes all of your direct and indirect dependencies. Snyk scans your manifest files and checks for license issues against Snyk known licenses.
