To enable customers to get started with license compliance faster, Snyk created a default license policy. The default policy is a baseline that tries to meet the requirements of multiple types of applications, SaaS, distributed, and so on. It may be used as a starting point to calibrate additional license policies. The default policy does not endorse or criticize any license.
By default, Snyk determines the severity of license issue in the following way:

High severity - licenses that definitely present issues for commercial software
Medium severity - licenses with clauses that may be of concern and should be reviewed
