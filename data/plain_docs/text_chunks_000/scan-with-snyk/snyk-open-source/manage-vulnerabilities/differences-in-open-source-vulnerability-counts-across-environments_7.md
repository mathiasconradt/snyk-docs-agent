Snyk has more vulnerabilities in its database and may include them sooner than other databases do. Thus results may be different from tests done with other tools such as npm-audit.
When comparing results between tools, consider the following:

Is what is being scanned the same? For example, were the projects built on different machines at different times without a lockfile that ensures similar dependencies?
Are there "ignore" rules configured in one tool but not in the other?
Does one tool evaluate developer dependencies while the other does not? Snyk does not evaluate developer dependencies by default to reduce noise not seen in production.
Does the vendor "scrape databases" or does it curate and review issues and their severities like Snyk does?
How does the tool count issues? Is one issue counted for every instance or path of a vulnerability? Or does the tool group the paths to the offending package?

All of these differences can lead to different package dependency trees being evaluated, resulting in different security and license issues being identified.
