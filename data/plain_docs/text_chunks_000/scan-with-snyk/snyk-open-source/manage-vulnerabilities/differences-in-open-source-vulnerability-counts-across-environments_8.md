Consider the case of setting ignores for certain vulnerabilities in a GitHub-originated Project. When the same Project is scanned with the CLI, the vulnerabilities that were ignored in the Web UI were found again, and the build failed.
This occurred because ignores set in the Web UI are not duplicated in the local version of the Project.
When you ignore a vulnerability using the CLI command snyk ignore, a .snyk policy file is created and saved locally in a .snyk file in the folder of your Project. For information on how this file is created, see The .snyk file.
If you ignore a vulnerability through the Snyk Web UI, there is no mechanism for the ignore policy to be propagated from the Web UI to the local .snyk file in your Project folder. This is why when you run snyk test after ignoring a vulnerability using the Snyk Web UI, you see that vulnerability in the CLI test results.
That is, ignores are not showing because you created them in the Project imported from GitHub while the CLI is running through the CLI integration with snyk. For Snyk, the local Project and the Project in your account are two separate Projects, so the ignores work only for the scans of GitHub.
If you want the ignores to be effective in the CLI, create the Project from the CLI and apply the ignores in the CLI as follows:

Go to the root of your Project and run snyk monitor.
Go to the Snyk Web UI; there is a new Project that has the name of the Project in the package.json file with the CLI icon.
Use the snyk ignore command to ignore the issue in the new Project. You can also set ignores in the Web UI for a Project created with the CLI.
Run snyk test and snyk monitor and see if this solution ignores the issues you intend to ignore. Wait a minute or two to allow some caches to expire. Then look at the Projects screen to see if what you intended is ignored.

An alternative is to run the snyk ignore command in the CLI and commit the resulting .snyk policy file to your branch in GitHub to apply ignores for all Snyk environments.
Note that you must commit the .snyk policy file each time you make a change in the ignore settings.
