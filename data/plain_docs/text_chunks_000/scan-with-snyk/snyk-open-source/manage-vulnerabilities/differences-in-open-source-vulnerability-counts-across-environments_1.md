When you scan a local repository using the CLI, snyk test builds a dependency graph based on the source files in your build environment. When you run a test with the CLI using snyk test or make a snapshot for ongoing testing using snyk monitor, Snyk looks at the dependencies as detected by the build tool (for example, Maven, npm, and so on) in order to see exactly what your Project relies on. Private dependencies and the specifics of your build environment are all available to the build tool and so to Snyk as well.
