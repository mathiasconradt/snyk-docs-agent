For Go Modules Projects imported using a Git integration, dependencies are resolved at the module level rather than the package level, as Snyk does not have full access to the Project source code.
This means you may see more issues reported for Projects tested in the Git repository because Snyk reports all vulnerabilities for each module rather than for the package(s) referenced in the source code.
