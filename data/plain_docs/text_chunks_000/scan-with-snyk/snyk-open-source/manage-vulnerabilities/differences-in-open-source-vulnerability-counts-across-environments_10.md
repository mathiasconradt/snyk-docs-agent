When you need the most accurate possible results, scan using the CLI. When you can rely on an approximation of the vulnerabilities or have a lockfile that is supported, scan using one of the Git integrations in the Snyk Web UI.
Scanning through an SCM integration in the Web UI allows you to scan a lot of repositories quickly. Thus, for example, if a security manager scans 50 Projects and 45 repositories are found to have no vulnerabilities, and five have vulnerabilities, the manager can ask developers to scan those five with the CLI and explore the results in greater depth.
The drawback is that for the other 45 repositories, you may miss vulnerabilities because you are relying on an approximation.
