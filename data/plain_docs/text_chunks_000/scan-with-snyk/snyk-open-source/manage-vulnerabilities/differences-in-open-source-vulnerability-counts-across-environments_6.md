By default, Snyk does not scan for dependencies listed in the dev dependencies section of the manifest file. You can enable scanning of dev dependencies in the following ways:

Using the Snyk CLI, add the command line option --dev.
Using the Snyk Web UI, click on Settings > Snyk Open Source and select the language, for example, JavaScript. Then select Scan and fix dev dependencies or the similar option for each language where such an option is available.
