If Snyk recommends using a direct dependency with the same version as the one used to fix an affected transitive dependency, you can update to a newer version of the transitive dependency by reinstalling the direct dependency.
Consider a Project that relies on react-scripts@5.0.1, a direct dependency that has a vulnerable component, a transitive dependency calledloader-utils@2.0.2.  Snyk recommends updating react-scripts to the version 5.0.1 to fix the vulnerable component. After the update, the vulnerable package loader-utils is still at the version 2.0.2. This indicates that another package in the Project is preventing the upgrade to a higher version. Reinstalling the react-scripts@5.0.1 direct dependency addresses this issue, as you can later upgrade the vulnerable component.
