Most of the vulnerabilities in the Snyk database originate from one of these sources:

Monitoring other vulnerability databases, such as CVEs from NVD and many others.
Monitoring user activity on GitHub, including issues, PRs, and commit messages that may indicate a vulnerability.
Bulk research, using tools that look for repeated security mistakes across open-source package code.
Manual research, done by the Snyk Security team to manually audit more widely used packages for security flaws.

For every issue deemed to be a real vulnerability, Snyk assigns the correct CVSS (severity) score and package version specification, creates an advisory, and makes this issue available to Snyk products for your use.
