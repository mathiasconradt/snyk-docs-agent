The Snyk Vulnerability Database contains a comprehensive list of known security vulnerabilities. This provides the key security information used by Snyk products to find and fix code vulnerabilities.
You can inspect the database at https://security.snyk.io/, or you can incorporate database information into your own systems.

This database is separate from standards bodies’ databases, as Snyk is recognized as an official authority on security.
