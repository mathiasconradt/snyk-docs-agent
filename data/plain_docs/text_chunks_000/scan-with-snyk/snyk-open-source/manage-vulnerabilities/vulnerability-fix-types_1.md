The Computed Fixability filters include the following:

Fixable: There is a fix for all the identified issues, meaning that all detailed paths have remediation, and the issue is fixable. The "Fix this vulnerability" button is available for supported ecosystems and imports. This option is not available for Projects imported using the CLI or ecosystems for which the Fix PRs are not supported. 
Partially fixable: The issue has upgradable paths; Snyk has found ways of upgrading the current Project. If the ecosystem is JavaScript or TypeScript using the npm or Yarn package manager, and one but not all detailed paths have remediation, then the issue is Partially fixable, and the Partially fix this vulnerability option is available.
No supported fix: The issue has no upgradable paths.
