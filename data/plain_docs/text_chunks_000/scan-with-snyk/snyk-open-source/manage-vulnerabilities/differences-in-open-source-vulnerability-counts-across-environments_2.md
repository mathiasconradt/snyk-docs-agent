When you scan a remote repository through an SCM integration using the Snyk Web UI, Snyk infers the dependencies based on the files it can see. Therefore, a scan with the CLI may find more vulnerabilities than a scan through the Snyk Web UI.
Specifically, when Snyk runs a test using an SCM integration such as the GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket server integration, Snyk processes only the dependency manifest files for the Project, for example, the pom.xml, package-lock.json, Gemfile.lock or other supported manifest file. 
The Snyk integration then infers the dependency graph of your Project, approximating the operation of the build tool. A Snyk SCM Integration does not have access to private dependencies or the specifics of your build environment, such as environment variables. Hence the results may be partial, or the results may be slightly different from those from a scan using the Snyk CLI.
If the Project was scanned with a lockfile, the results may be different from the results of scanning the Project using a manifest file, such as package.json. In general, the lockfile, if it exists, gives a much more deterministic view of the dependency graph. If a lockfile exists, it is always preferred by both the CLI and the SCM integrations, and it allows the SCM integrations, in particular, to be much more accurate and to be similar to the CLI results. Therefore Snyk recommends using a lockfile if possible.
