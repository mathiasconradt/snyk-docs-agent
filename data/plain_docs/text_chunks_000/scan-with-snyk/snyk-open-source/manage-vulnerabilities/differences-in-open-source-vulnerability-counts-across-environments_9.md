If a Project is created with snyk monitor in the CLI and ignores are added in the Web UI, when you run snyk test on the local Project, the ignores created in the Web UI are taken into account.
If the Project is created by an SCM integration, there are two different Projects, one created using the CLI and the other by an SCM integration. These two Projects may have the same name but will have a different icon. If you add an Ignore in Web UI for the Git Project and test the Project locally, the ignores added in the Web UI are not taken into account.
