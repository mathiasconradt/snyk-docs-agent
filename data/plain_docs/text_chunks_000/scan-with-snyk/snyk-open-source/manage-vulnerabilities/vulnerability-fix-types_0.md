After you have imported one or more Projects into Snyk through an integration or by scanning with the CLI, Snyk lists vulnerabilities found. To see the list, navigate to Projects, select the Target containing the Project where you want to see the vulnerabilities and select the Project to open the list of issues.

The list of issues does not show any vulnerabilities that have been fixed. These are no longer considered vulnerabilities.

The sidebar on the list of issues has groups of filters. The ones referring to vulnerabilities are:

The Computed Fixability filters allow you to see the vulnerabilities based on their remediation paths.
The "Fixed in" Available filters allow you to see if the found vulnerabilities have a version in which they were fixed.
