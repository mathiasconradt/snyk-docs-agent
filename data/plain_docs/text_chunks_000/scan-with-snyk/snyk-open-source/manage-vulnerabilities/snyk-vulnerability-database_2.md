The Snyk Vulnerability Database uses interval notation to express semantic versioning across the many supported ecosystems.
You can check the interval notation for all vulnerabilities listed in the Snyk Vulnerabilities Database. Several different interval notations are supported by the Snyk Vulnerability Database:

Open interval notation - This does not include any limit points and uses () parenthesis for the notation.

Open interval notation

Closed interval notation - This includes all its limit points and uses [] parenthesis for the notation. 

Closed interval notation

Half-closed interval notation - This includes only one of the limit points and uses [) or (] parenthesis for the notation. This example includes an infinite closed interval presented like this [,3.7.2), meaning that it affects all versions up to 3.7.2.
