The Fix Advice area appears on the Project details page. Snyk offers you one of these solutions:

An upgrade to the original package.
Pinning a package, installing a package as a top-level dependency; that is, a specific version of an indirect dependency. This avoids having a direct dependency pull in a vulnerable version.
A Snyk precision patch to fix the issue. If an upgrade to fix any of the vulnerabilities in the package is not currently available, Snyk offers patches to fix the issues

The summary area groups advice by package, and is displayed based on the best available fix. Advice in these summary lists includes these details for each package:

All vulnerability names and severity details affecting that package
The recommended fix, a link to the recommended fix for this package and its listed vulnerabilities: either the specific version to which to upgrade or the name of the patch.

Upgradable issues tab
You can also find additional advice and details further down on the Project details page:

From the Issues, tab, a full description per vulnerability
From the Dependencies tab, the entire tree of your Project dependencies, enabling you to clearly visualize affected paths
