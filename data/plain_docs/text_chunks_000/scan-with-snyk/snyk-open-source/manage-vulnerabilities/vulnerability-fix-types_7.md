You cannot automatically fix transitive dependencies or open a Fix PR (see Fix your vulnerabilities: Apply fixes) due to their relationships with other components. To avoid breaking changes, Snyk provides only recommendations for transitive dependencies.

To fix a transitive dependency like the one in this example, follow the link to the Snyk Vulnerability Database:
LInk to Snyk Vulnerability Database for a transitive dependency
From the Snyk Vulnerability Database, you can see remediation advice for more fix information:
