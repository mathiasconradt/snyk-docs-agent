Consider this example:

A sub-dependency requires foo ^0.0.5 and during build foo 0.0.6 was installed and had a vulnerability.
Then foo 0.0.7 was released, patching the vulnerability after foo 0.0.6 had been installed.
According to Snyk rules, an integration would assume that foo 0.0.7 was installed, but in scanning the local Project itself, foo 0.0.7 is not taken into account.

If the Snyk Web UI finds vulnerabilities, the CLI does not try deleting the Project from the Project settings and re-importing the Project. If the problem persists, submit a request to Snyk support.
