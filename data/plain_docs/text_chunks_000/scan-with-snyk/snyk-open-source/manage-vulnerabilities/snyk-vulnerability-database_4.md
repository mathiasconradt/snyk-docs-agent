Incorporating information into your own systems may be useful for customers who already have their own security products; you can benefit from Snyk’s expertise and accumulated knowledge with access to this database. This gives your development teams access to trusted intelligence, allowing them to rapidly secure open source and container code.
The Snyk Vulnerability Database includes two feeds:

Application Feed: with manually-curated content and summaries, including code snippets where applicable.
Operation System Feed: Linux vulnerabilities from all supported Linux distros.

These feeds are licensed separately as standalone products.
