In some package managers such as Gradle and sbt, the Snyk SCM Integrations with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and so on rely on parsing the manifest file or files to determine dependencies, whereas these package managers frequently rely on code to build the dependency tree.
Dependency overrides and mapping using code can sometimes cause the CLI to report a more accurate picture of dependencies than when Snyk scans a Project imported through the SCM.
