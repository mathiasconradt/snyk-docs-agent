Supported projects\
The Artifactory Package Repository integration supports Node.js (npm and Yarn) and Maven Projects. For Improved Gradle SCM scanning, use the Maven settings on this page.

Snyk can use custom Artifactory Package Repositories with Maven Projects.
This enables Snyk to resolve all direct and transitive dependencies of packages hosted on the custom registry and calculate a more complete, accurate dependency graph and related vulnerabilities.
Maven Projects can be configured to mirror all requests through a custom package repository, or you can specify additional repositories to use alongside Maven Central.
