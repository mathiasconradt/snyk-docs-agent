If authentication is required for access to your custom registry, you must configure the Artifactory package repository integration; see Artifactory Package Repository connection setup.
After the integration is set up, you can configure Maven settings by navigating to Settings > Languages > Java.
You can choose whether to use Artifactory as a mirror or as an additional repository where your artifacts will reside. These settings will be very similar to what you have in ~/.m2/settings.xml.
