Maven settings, choose Type
Choose a value for the Type, either Direct or, if you are using authentication, Integration.
If you are using Direct, you must complete the URL, Repository Name, and what it is a Mirror Of.
The Mirror Of value can either be a * to mirror everything, or you can type in a value, for example, central.
If you are using the Type Integration, you must choose an integration type and provide the Repository Name and Mirror Of details.
Set the Repository Name as whatever comes after artifactory/ in the internal repository URL.
For example, if the URL is http://artifactory.company.io/artifactory/libs-release Repository Name should be set as libs-release.
