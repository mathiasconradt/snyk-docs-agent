The Test Dep Graph API takes a generic dependency graph and returns a report containing any relevant vulnerabilities for those dependencies.
The supported package managers and repository ecosystems are listed in the Test Dep Graph and Monitor Dep Graph documentation.
Any of your Bazel dependencies that are available in the supported ecosystems can be tested using the Snyk API.
