The TEst Dep Graph API returns a JSON object describing any issues (vulnerabilities and licenses) found in the Dep Graph dependencies.
An example response with a single vulnerability follows:

Further notes on specific components in the response object follow:

ok - Boolean value summarizing whether Snyk found any vulnerabilities in the supplied dependencies. You can use this for a quick pass or fail test.
issuesData - a hash of each unique vulnerability found. Each vulnerability contains many useful properties, such as title, description, identifiers, publicationTime, severity, and so on.
issues - a simple array of mappings from vulnerabilities in issuesData to package. As a vulnerability may be relevant to multiple packages, this mapping is used to keep the response length as short as possible.
