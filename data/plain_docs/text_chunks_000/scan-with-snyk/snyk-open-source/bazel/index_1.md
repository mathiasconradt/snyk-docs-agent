Snyk for Bazel is supported only for Snyk Open Source.
Snyk supports testing Projects that have their dependencies managed by Bazel. The recommended approach is to test and monitor using the Dep Graph API. While you can use Bazel for many languages including C++, the Dep Graph endpoints do not support C++.
