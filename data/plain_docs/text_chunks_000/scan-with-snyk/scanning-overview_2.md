Using the Snyk CLI, you can scan locally on your machine. This is useful in scanning open-source and static code as well as containers and infrastructure as code configurations, including complex files that are templated with variables, such as Terraform plan files.
Using Snyk IDE Plugins, you can test your open-source packages, first-party code, and infrastructure as code (IaC) Kubernetes deployment files in your development environment as you create your Project.
Using Git integrations, you can improve security in your Git repositories for both your code and deployed applications.
Using CI/CD integrations, you can fail the build in your integration and deployment pipeline to keep vulnerabilities out of your code.
