Error reading manifest
Snyk failed to read 1 or more manifest files.
Sometimes things go wrong: a flaky connection, 3rd party services go down and Snyk is unable to read the files needed in order to test your project. 
If this happens, you could try:

Opening and re-opening your Pull Request / Merge Request, to kick off a new test
Removing and re-adding the repo to Snyk

Ultimately, you should contact support@snyk.io if the issue persists
