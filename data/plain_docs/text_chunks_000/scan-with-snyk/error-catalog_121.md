The 10 GB space limit for downloaded Golang dependencies has been exceeded
The total size of the downloaded Golang dependencies in the manifest file exceeds the 10GB limit.
This often happens due to the large size or large number of Golang dependencies.
Currently this is a product limitation for SCM. As a workaround, use the 'snyk monitor' command via Snyk CLI.
