This utility can be used to skip previously imported Targets (repos), so only remaining Targets will be imported.
The utility helps generate the imported-targets.log file by analyzing the Projects already in a given Snyk Group. When present in the logging path, this file is used to look up Targets that should be skipped during the import.
