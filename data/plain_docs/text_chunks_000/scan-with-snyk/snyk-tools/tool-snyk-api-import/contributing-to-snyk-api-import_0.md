Contributor Agreement
A pull-request will only be considered for merging into the upstream codebase after you have signed Snyk's contributor agreement, assigning to Snyk the rights to the contributed code and granting you a license to use it in return. If you submit a pull request, you will be prompted to review and sign the agreement with one click (Snyk uses CLA assistant).
