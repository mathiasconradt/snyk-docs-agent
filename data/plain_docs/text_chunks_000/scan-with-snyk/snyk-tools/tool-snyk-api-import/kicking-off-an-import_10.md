All GitHub repositories have been imported into Snyk into their respective Organizations during initial onboarding.
New GitHub repositories have since been added and now need to be added to Snyk.
To avoid importing everything again, you can use this utility and run import again to import only "new" GitHub repositories. This is much faster and removes unnecessary calls to Snyk and GitHub to fetch files and do the import for everything again.
