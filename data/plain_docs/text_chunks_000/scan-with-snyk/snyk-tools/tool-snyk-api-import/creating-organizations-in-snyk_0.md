Recommendations

Before an import can begin you must set up Snyk with the Organizations you will populate with Projects.
Snyk recommends that you have as many Organizations in Snyk as you have in the source you are importing from. For GitHub, this means mirroring the GitHub organizations in Snyk. The snyk-api-import tool provides a utility to use to make this simpler when using Groups and Organizations in Snyk.
