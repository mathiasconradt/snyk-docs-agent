This utility helps generate data needed to mirror the GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, Bitbucket Server, or Bitbucket Cloud organization structure in Snyk. This opinionated utility will assume every organization in GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, Bitbucket Server, or Bitbucket Cloud should become an Organization in Snyk. If this is not what you are looking for, consider using the API endpoint Create a new organization directly to create the structure you need.
