Import Projects (v1)
Projects can be Git repositories, Docker images, containers, configuration files, and much more. For more information, see Snyk Projects; the page includes the Targets definition.
A typical import starts with using the endpoint Import targets to request a target to be processed. Then, use the endpoint Get import job details to poll the Import Job AP I for further details on completion and resulting Snyk Projects.
