The Snyk V1 API endpoint List all aggregated issues returns an array of ignoreReasons for each vulnerability. This happens because ignores implemented using the CLI and API are path-based and thus potentially could have different ignoreReasons for different paths. Because List all aggregated issues returns only one issue for all paths, the entire set of reasons is returned. Snyk groups issues together by their identifier, so one response for the List all aggregated issues endpoint could correspond to the same issue across multiple paths. Thus the ignoredReason is across all issues that are aggregated and applies to that single grouped issue.
