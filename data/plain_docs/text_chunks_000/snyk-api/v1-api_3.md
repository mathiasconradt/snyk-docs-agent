Snyk limits the requests to the V1 API to help provide a stable experience for customers.
The V1 API has a default rate limit of 2,000 requests per minute, but some specific endpoints have lower limits. Refer to the reference docs for each endpoint to see the rate limits.
If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a 429 error response.
