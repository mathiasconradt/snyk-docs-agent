Snyk provides an OAuth2 API, primarily for use with Snyk Apps. It complies with RFC 6749.
Most endpoints are served from the Snyk API subdomain (for example, https://api.snyk.io), with the one exception being /oauth2/authorize which is served on the main app subdomain (for example, https://app.snyk.io).
