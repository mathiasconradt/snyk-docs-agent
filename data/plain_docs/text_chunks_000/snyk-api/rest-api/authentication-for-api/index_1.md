You can find your personal API token in your personal General Account Settings after you register with Snyk and log in. In the key field, Click to show. Then, highlight and copy the API key.
If you want a new API token, select Revoke & Regenerate. This will make the previous API token invalid. For details, see Revoke and regenerate a Snyk API token.
