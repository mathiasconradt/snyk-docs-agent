This section provides an introduction to the REST API and resources to help you get started and authenticate.
The Changelog lists additions and changes to endpoints documented in the Reference.

Note that the date updated in the changelog is not a valid version number. The valid version number precedes the date updated in each section. For example, in the section "2024-10-15 - Updated 2025-02-11," 2024-10-15 is the valid version number.

For more information about changes in the APIs, see API End of Life (EOL) process and migration guides.
For help finding information about how to use the Snyk API, see API endpoints index and notes.
