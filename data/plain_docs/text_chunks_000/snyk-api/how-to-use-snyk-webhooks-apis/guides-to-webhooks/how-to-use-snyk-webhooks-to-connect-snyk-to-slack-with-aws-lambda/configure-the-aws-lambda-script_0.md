You can configure the example code provided in multiple ways to get the information you want into Slack.
The key areas are the payload (where the Slack message is configured) and the filtering (where the Snyk information is processed).
Apart from these areas, you also configure the encryption and secret verification. Configuring these is beyond the scope of these instructions.
