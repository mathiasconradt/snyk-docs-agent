About the V1 API

The Snyk API is available only for Enterprise plans.
For more information, see Plans and pricing.
The V1 API will be sunset eventually, as further Snyk developments are now focused on the REST API.

The V1 API enables you to test a package for issues as they are defined by Snyk, and to automate Snyk processes to accomplish your specific workflows. Customers and partners can perform functions including:

Accessing vulnerability data
Scanning Projects and applications
Receiving remediation advice
Viewing user data to build custom security solutions

The V1 API endpoints are available in the Reference in the Snyk user docs. Updates are made in the user docs. Endpoints migrated to the user docs remain online also.
