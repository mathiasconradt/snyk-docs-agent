The Snyk Apps platform uses an OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. This allows your Snyk App to get an access token to act on behalf of the user, depending on the scopes you request. There are many OAuth 2.0 libraries available that will greatly simplify the integration. The Snyk Apps Demo uses the popular JavaScript library passport.js.
See the Snyk OAuth2 API documentation for details.
