Using the project's API handler and controller we created in this module, you should have all you need to create your own custom code and make your Snyk App do whatever you'd like it to do.
We used the v1 API but keep an eye on Snyk's REST API. As additional features are added, you may find new or more efficient endpoints to use in your Snyk App.
