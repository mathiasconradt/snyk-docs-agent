There are two methods for retrieving an orgid. The first is to log in to your Snyk account and visit the organization settings page of the Organization for which you wish to retrieve the ID. The path to the Organization settings page is:
https://app.snyk.io/org//manage/settings
Alternatively, you may retrieve an Organization's orgid using the https://api.snyk.io/v1/orgs API endpoint, using your API token in the authorization header. For details about this endpoint, view its documentation.
