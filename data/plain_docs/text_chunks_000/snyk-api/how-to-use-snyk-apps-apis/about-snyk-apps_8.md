On the Authorized Snyk Apps page, you will see a list of all the Snyk Apps that you have integrated and authorized. The page displays relevant information about each App, including the date when it was authorized.
If you wish to revoke access for a particular Snyk App:

Locate the specific App in the list of authorized Apps.
Click the Revoke button next to the App.

Revoking access will prevent the App from further accessing your Snyk account and performing actions on your behalf. This gives you full control over which Apps can interact with your Snyk data and ensures that you can manage your App integrations securely.
By using the Snyk Apps management UI, you can maintain a clear overview of your authorized Apps and make adjustments to their access as needed, enhancing the security and customization of your Snyk experience.
