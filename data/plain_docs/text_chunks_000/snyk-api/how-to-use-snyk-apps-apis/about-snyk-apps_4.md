When a user authorizes a Snyk App that has the tenant context, the user selects the way to connect to either a Snyk Organization or a Group, with access to either all or one of the Organizations in the Group. The resulting connection is no longer tied to that specific user, so it is not bound by the user’s access or lifecycle but is linked to the lifecycle of the Organization. For more information, see Organizations and  Groups.
The scopes of an App determine which actions an App can perform while connected to a Snyk account. Thescopes are related to actions performed through Snyk Organizations, which determine the API endpoints that can be used in an App. Endpoints authorized through a Snyk Group are not supported. For more information about scopes, see Scopes to request.
