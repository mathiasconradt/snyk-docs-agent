Snyk Apps are integrations that extend the functionality of the Snyk platform, allowing you to create a Snyk experience to suit your specific needs.
For example, a Snyk App might automate Snyk application security testing as part of a build tool. Another Snyk App might stream Snyk security testing results into an incident management tool.  You can create your own reporting, metrics, or even a user management App. You can move your automated Snyk API scripts and transform them into a Snyk App, which will add a better UX/UI experience for your Snyk Organization users.
The easiest way to start building a new Snyk App is to clone the Demo Snyk Apps GitHub repository. You can either modify the demo to suit your App design or use it as a base for creating your own Snyk App. See the Snyk Apps blog post for more details.
This document describes how to create a new Snyk App in the language of your choice. Use this document along with the API reference documentation for Snyk Apps.
Snyk Apps are based on the Snyk API so that your integrations are inherently stable and secure.
