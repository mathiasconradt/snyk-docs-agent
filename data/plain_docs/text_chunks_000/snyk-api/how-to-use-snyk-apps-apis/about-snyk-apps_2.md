When a Snyk App is created, it is set up to use a specific context, either tenant or user. Set this with the context field if you are creating a Snyk App with the API or the --context flag if you are using the CLI. If the context is not specified, a Snyk App will default to the tenant context, which is preferred unless your Snyk App specifically needs to perform operations as an individual user.
