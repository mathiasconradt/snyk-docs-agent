Repository assets
Snyk Essentials supports repository assets (from main branches) as an asset type. Repository assets are visible in all inventory layouts and are supported by Policies. To avoid duplication, assets are identified using a unique identifier, which is the git remote URL for repository assets.

For Snyk Essentials SCM imported repositories, archived or deleted repositories will not be displayed in the asset inventory and will not be shown in the dashboard widgets.
