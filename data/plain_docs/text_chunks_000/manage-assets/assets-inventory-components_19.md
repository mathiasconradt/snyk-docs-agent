The Clusters column lists all cluster names where an image is deployed and is using the runtime integrations as the source of the information. When an image is removed from a cluster, the cluster name is also deleted from the collection. Clusters are also available under Filters and allow you to filter assets in the Inventory view or to create policies in the Policies view.

The Cluster column is populated only when the Snyk Runtime Sensor is utilized.
