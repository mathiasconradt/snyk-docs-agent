You can identify a container image based on the Image ID. If multiple container images have the same Image ID, then only one image asset is generated for that Image ID, enriched with information from all the identified container images for that ID.
Snyk Essentials retrieves all image assets from Snyk Container. Reimport the images to ensure you scan the latest image. If you run a new scan on a Project that contains image assets, it rescans the same image for new vulnerabilities. To identify new image assets, you need to first reimport, and then scan the Project. Check the Detect application vulnerabilities in container images page for more details.
