To get better context and clarity over your asset inventory, Snyk Essentials allows flexible structuring with inventory layouts. Snyk Essentials includes four inventory layouts and groups assets by different contexts. You can find all inventory layouts under the Inventory menu option at the Group level: 

All Assets: All the discovered assets, grouped by their type. 
Asset Hierarchy: Asset Hierarchy layout shows assets in a hierarchical structure. The list of assets is sorted by issue counts, and, where applicable, the package assets are listed underneath the repositories where they are located. Assets hierarchy is visible only when there are no filters applied.
Teams: SCM repository assets grouped by teams. Note that only SCM organizations with teams, and repositories assigned to a team, appear on this layout.
Technology: SCM repository assets grouped by technology, as detected and tagged by Snyk Essentials.

Each inventory layout may include different counts of assets and scanned artifacts, depending on the grouping context. Otherwise, all columns and data manipulation features are the same on each inventory layout.
