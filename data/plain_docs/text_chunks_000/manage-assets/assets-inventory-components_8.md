The Controls column displays all of the Snyk products that were executed on a specific repository asset. This column displays, in circles, a logo for each Snyk product. The logo icon itself has an indication of the highest severity of issues from this source. For example, if the highest severity issue is C (critical), you can see a red dot on the control icon.
The Controls logos can have one of the following states:
