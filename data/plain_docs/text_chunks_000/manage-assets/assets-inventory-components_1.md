An asset in Snyk Essentials represents a component in the software development lifecycle that may pose a risk. The following asset types are available:

Repository assets Billable
Container images Billable
Packages
Scanned artifacts

An asset can be the parent of multiple items. For example, a repository asset usually contains one or more package assets.
The Asset column incorporates the name of the repository asset, package, scanned artifact, or container images. Click on the arrow next to the parent asset name to expand the list of all contained items. 
You can copy the name of an asset or browse the repository. Each asset has a menu at the end of the row. Click the menu, then select Copy to copy the URL or Browse to navigate to the asset repository.
