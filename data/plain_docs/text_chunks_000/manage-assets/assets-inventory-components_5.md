A scanned artifact in Snyk Essentials is an entity detected by Snyk that cannot be identified as a repository asset because it does not include identifying information, such as a Git remote URL. 
Scanned artifacts provide users with visibility into what Snyk Essentials detects from scans but require additional troubleshooting. 
You can find scanned artifacts in the Inventory Type view, but they are not supported by Policies. Scanned artifacts may include duplicates due to missing identifying information.
