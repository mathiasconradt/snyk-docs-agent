Snyk Essentials also includes the concept of scanned artifacts. A scanned artifact is an entity detected by Snyk that cannot be identified as a repository asset because it does not include identifying information, such as a Git remote URL. 
Scanned artifacts provide users with visibility into what Snyk Essentials detects from scans but require additional troubleshooting. 
You can see the scanned artifacts in the Inventory Type view. The scanned artifacts are not supported by Policies. Furthermore, scanned artifacts may include duplicates, as identifying information is missing.
