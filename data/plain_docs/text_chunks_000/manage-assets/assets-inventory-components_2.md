Repository assets represent SCM repositories. A repository asset is created by discovering the repositories directly in the SCM, when such integration is configured. Alternatively, a repository asset can be created by scanning a repository, (by Snyk or third-party tools) as long as the scanned code is identified with a specific repository (in Snyk, this means filling in the gitRemoteURL parameter).
If you scan the code locally using CLI, with no association to a repository, then a repository asset will not be created.
