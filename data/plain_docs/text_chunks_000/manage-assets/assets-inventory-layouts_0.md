Snyk defines an asset as a meaningful, real-world component in an application’s SDLC, where meaningful means either carries a risk or aggregates risk of other components (for example, repositories that contain packages), and real-world means that the concept exists outside of Snyk, for example, repository (which is a generally applicable term). In most cases, assets carry a risk or aggregate risk of other components, for example, repositories that contain packages.
Snyk Essentials inventory layouts are organizing your repository assets in meaningful ways, enabling you to:

Gain full repository asset visibility from your SCM tools, including details about configured teams and repository code committers.
Track controls coverage for Snyk products.
Prioritize coverage mitigation efforts according to business impact.


Each line in the inventory represents an asset.
