The SCM Repository freshness column provides you with an immediate understanding of the current status of your repositories, including the date of the last commit. This assists you in quickly identifying active and dormant Projects and helps you make decisions regarding maintenance, security patching, and resource allocation.
The repository freshness displays the repository status according to the last commit date:

Active: Had commits in the last 3 months.
Inactive: The last commits were made in the last 3 - 6 months.
Dormant: No commits in the last 6 months.
N/A: Commits data is unavailable.
