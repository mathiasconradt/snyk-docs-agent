Packages in Snyk Essentials are defined as software or libraries that are managed by package management systems. 
Package assets are created when you scan the dependencies of a Project through package management systems or by using the Snyk CLI. This enables Snyk Essentials to identify and analyze the security vulnerabilities of the packages used within a Project, offering insights into possible risk exposures and providing recommendations for mitigation.
