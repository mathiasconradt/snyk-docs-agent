The Issues column is designed to present a comprehensive list of issues that have been identified within your assets. These findings are the result of scans performed by Snyk as well as internal tools you may have deployed. This detailed list not only helps in understanding the security posture of your assets but also in prioritizing remediation efforts based on the severity and impact of each issue. By having visibility into these issues, you can take proactive steps toward improving the overall security of your applications and infrastructure.
Most of the issues are mapped to an asset. However, some of the issues are associated with an asset but not directly linked to it. This is the case with image assets. 
You can see these assets under the Inventory view, and they will also be reflected under the Asset and Source Code column from the Insights UI view. 
The Issues column from the Asset view is designed to present an aggregated count of open issues. These counts are carefully categorized based on the severity level of the issues found in assets, their children's assets, or associated packages. The severity is divided into four distinct levels:

C (Critical): Issues that represent a serious threat and should be addressed immediately to prevent potential exploits or major disruptions.
H (High): These are significant issues that, while not immediately dangerous, could potentially lead to critical vulnerabilities if not resolved in a timely manner.
M (Medium): Issues of medium severity might not pose an immediate threat but are still important to fix as part of regular maintenance to improve overall security and functionality.
L (Low): These are considered minor issues that have a low impact on the security of the system and operation but should still be addressed to maintain optimal performance and prevent future vulnerabilities.

This classification streamlines prioritization, helping you focus on critical areas and optimize remediation.
